This section details my planned research. 

I have organized this section into the 5 papers I plan to publish and ultimately compile as my dissertation.
Each sub-section describes the paper's focus, my hypotheses, and how I plan to collect and analyze the data.

I spent the bulk of the past 12 months developing and validating the method described in Section \@ref(cleatmark-method-development-chapter).
I also completed collecting data for the experiment described in Section \@ref(oversize-particles-atterberg-limits-experiment).
Figure \@ref(fig:gantt-chart) shows envisaged timelines for the rest of the project.

## Paper 1: Cleat-in cleat out method {#cleatmark-method-development-chapter}

Paper title: **A laboratory method to measure deformation of baseball and softball infield skin soils** 

### Overview 

The goal of this test is to identify a single water content at which a given soil transitions abruptly from cleat-in cleat-out behavior to a clod-forming failure mode.

The level of detail in this section could be viewed as excessive, but I feel this is the appropriate place to document my efforts in validating the method. It has many steps and each has been validated independently.

### Principal research questions

1. Can a laboratory method developed to replicate the interaction between an athlete's footwear and a small soil specimen?
2. What measurements best enumerate infield soil "performance?" 
3. How accurate and repeatable is the method?

### Hypotheses

1. The "cleat-in, cleat-out" phenomenon (described in Section \@ref(corkboard-effect-section)) can be duplicated using a machine and a laboratory-sized soil specimen rather than outdoor plots and human subjects. 
1. The means by which the soil specimen is prepared will affect the test result. Therefore, a protocol must be developed which adequately emulates the real procedures used for construction and maintenance of infield skins. The method must also simulate outdoor conditions to adjust the soil water content.
1. Subjective assessments can be eliminated through use of 3D scanning technology to measure the response of the soil. 
1. For a given soil, a critical water content threshold can be identified where disruption of the surface is minimized.
1. The obtained water content from (4) will be similar across multiple surface metrics (i.e. volume change, surface area, curvature).

### Materials and Methods

A mechanical apparatus was fabricated to emulate the interaction between a baseball or softball athlete's cleated footwear and a soil surface. (Figure \@ref(fig:cleat-mark-device)). The device was designed and fabricated in spring of 2020 by the Penn State State Engineering Services Shop. 

```{r cleat-mark-device, fig.cap="Left: The pneumatic apparatus used to simulate foot-to-surface interaction. Right: A typical 9-spike baseball cleat pattern.", fig.scap="Pneumatic cleat-mark testing device", fig.show="hold", fig.align='default', out.width="50%", eval=TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics('images/cleatmark_device.png')
knitr::include_graphics('images/nine-spike-pattern.jpg')

```


The apparatus comprises a pneumatic cylinder, a guide shaft, and and a plate for mounting baseball cleats removed from an actual shoe. 
The device is charged by a benchtop air compressor. Pneumatic power was chosen for its combination of high travel speed with good control of the peak load. 

There are five main steps in the test: 

1. Prepare the soil specimen
2. Produce cleat indentations with the apparatus
3. Record a 3D mesh of the tested specimen
4. Determine the water content of a small, representative sample
5. Derive surface properties from the mesh

Each step was individually scrutinized through small pilot experiments to develop an optimal procedure. Investigated parameters include:

**Sample preparation**:

- compaction energy (standard vs. modified Proctor routine)
- drydown procedure (heat lamp type, wattage, distance, duration)
- timing of water additions and repairs

**Device operation:**

- loading pressure 
- number of cleats
- orientation of cleats
- torsion angle

**Scanner configuration**:

- angle from horizontal
- distance from specimen
- rotational step size 

**Morphometric analysis**:

- cleaning and orientation adjustments
- pointcloud reduction (decimation)
- comparison of derived morphometrics


#### Method overview

This sub-section is a high-level description of the method, from creating a soil mixture to a final result. 


##### Producing the mix

Modern infield soils are blended from two components - a (nearly) pure sand, and a fine-grained soil. 
Mixes are often categorized on the basis of their total sand-size content. 
For the purpose of simplicity, this sub-section refers to the two mixture components as "sand" and "clay", temporarily ignoring these terms' important particle-size and mineralogical connotations (see [Definition of Terms](#definition-of-terms).
Nearly all "sands" have a measurable quantity of particles <2 &mu;m sieve diameter, and nearly all "clays" have a measurable quantity of particles >50 &mu;m.^[the lower boundary of sand-size particles as defined by USDA classification system [@USDA1999]  ]
To produce a mixture having $S$% percent sand-size particles by oven-dry mass requires knowledge of:

  - the fines content of the "sand" 
  
  - the sand content of the "fines" 
  
  - the extant gravimetric water content $w$ of each component. 

Computing the air-dry masses of each soil then requires a solution to a basic 2-member system of equations \@ref(eq:sand-clay-ratios)
The variables are defined as:

- $S_{final}$: the final mixture's sand percentage as a decimal 
- $S_{sand}$: mass fraction of the "sand" > 53 &mu;m as a decimal.
- $S_{clay}$: mass fraction of the "clay" > 53 &mu;m as a decimal. Note that because $S_{ sand}$ and $S_{clay}$ are referenced to different soils, $S_{sand}~+~S_{clay}~\neq~S_{final}$

- $m_{sand}$: oven-dry mass fraction of the "sand" _as a decimal percentage of the final mixture mass_

- $m_{clay}$: oven-dry mass fraction of the "clay" _as added to the final mixture_

- $m_{final}$: the total oven-dry mass of the final mixture, equal to unity.

- $w$: gravimetric water content of a soil, normalized to the oven-dry soil solids, in decimal form.


The total oven-dry mass of the mixture is equal to unity; therefore the clay mass can be solved as a function of the sand mass:

\begin{align*}
m_{final} = m_{sand} + m_{clay} &= 1 \\
m_{clay} &= 1 - m_{ sand} \\
\end{align*}

The percent > 53 &mu;m (i.e. sand-size) of the final mixture is a weighted average between the sand-size percentages of each component and the masses of each component used in the mixture:

$$S_{final} = (~m_{sand}~\cdot~S_{sand})~+~(~m_{clay}~\cdot~S_{clay})$$
Substituting for $m_{clay}$, we obtain


$$S_{final} = (~m_{sand}~\cdot~S_{sand})~+~\left[(1-m_{sand}~)\cdot~S_{clay}~\right]$$ 


Which can be distributed and rearranged to isolate $m_{sand}$:

\begin{align*}
S_{final} - S_{clay} &= ( m_{sand} \cdot S_{sand}) - (m_{sand} \cdot S_{clay}) \\ 
S_{final}  -S_{clay} &= m_{sand}\cdot( S_{sand} - S_{clay}) \\
m_{sand} &= \frac{S_{final} - S_{clay}}{S_{sand} - S_{clay}}\\
\end{align*}

And because $m_{clay}=1-m_{sand}$,

\begin{equation*}
m_{clay} = 1 - \left( \frac{S_{final} - S_{clay}}{S_{sand} - S_{clay}} \right)\\
\end{equation*}

Each oven-dry component mass is then corrected for its respective hygroscopic water content and scaled to the desired final mixture mass:

\begin{align}
  \begin{split} \\
    m_{sand (air-dry)} &= m_{sand}\cdot (1+w) \\
    \text{Sand~air-dry~mass~(kg)} &= \frac{S_{clay}-S_{clay}}{S_{sand} - S_{clay}} \cdot (1+w_{sand }) \cdot m_{total~mixture~(kg)} \\
    \text{Clay~air-dry~mass~(kg)} &= \left[1 - \left( \frac{S_{final} - S_{clay}}{S_{sand} - S_{clay}} \right) \right] \cdot (1+w_{clay})\cdot m_{total~mixture~(kg)}
(\#eq:sand-clay-ratios)
  \end{split} \\
\end{align}


For example, assume 50 kg of final mix having 6% sand-size particles is required. The "sand" mix component is 96% sand-size and the "clay" mix component is 8% sand-size.
The gravimetric water content of the sandy component $w_{sand}$ is 0.2%, i.e. 0.002, and $w_{clay}$ is 1.9%, i.e. 0.019.


Plugging these values into the equations gives an air-dry "sand" component mass of `r round((0.6-0.08)/(0.96-0.08)*50*1.002, 1)` kg and an air-dry "clay" component mass of `r round((1-((0.6-0.08)/(0.96-0.08)))*50*1.019, 1)` kg.

$$\left(\frac{0.60~-~0.08}{0.96~-~0.08}\right)~\times~(1+0.002)~\times 50~kg~=~25.46~\text{kg}$$


To make these calculations efficient and reproducible, the above forumlae have been compiled into a set of functions in the R Language for Statistical Computing.


#### Preparing the specimen

An important consideration in this test's development is accurately simulating the conditions encountered on actual infields. As discussed in Section \@ref(ball-response-lit-review), infield soils are intentionally compacted to extremely high densities.
The infield also undergoes frequent wetting and drying cycles. These affect soil water potential and may also induce volume change.

A sample preparation routine was developed using two main criteria:

1. Emulate the conditions found on actual infields 

2. Reduce operator-dependence by using standardized protocols for compaction and repairs

Soils of varying grain size and plasticity exhibit different behavior under compaction. Rather than  compacting all samples to the same dry density, it was deemed more approproate to compact each sample at its respective optimum water content ($w_{opt}$). Therefore, a compaction test was required _prior_ to any sample construction for actual cleat-mark testing. 

The two most widely-used compaction tests are the Standard and Modified Proctor tests, designated by ASTM D698 and D1557 [-@ASTMD698-12; @ASTMD15572015].
The equipment used to compact infield soils is generally smaller than that used for larger earthworks projects. 
It is not immediately clear which Proctor test corresponds better to infield soil construction. Unfortunately there is no straightforward conversion from the roller size used in actual construction activity to the compaction energy applied during a laboratory test. 
@Selig1971 provided a formula for the simple case of a cylindrical drum towed across a soil surface, but this type of equipment is rarely used on infields. Furthermore, the calculation depends on the coefficient of rolling resistance which varies with water content and soil stiffness. 

An analytical solution is not necessarily required. Both Proctor test varieties were developed by comparing the laboratory test results with densities observed in successful earthworks projects [@Proctor1933a; @Holtz2010]. 
A similar empirical approach was taken for this study. 
Compaction tests were performed were performed at both efforts on a widely-used commercial infield mix.
The lab tests were compared with density values obtained from intact core sampling on an MLB infield (Figure \@ref(fig:proctor-vs-observed-infield-density)).
The observed values from the staduim fall somewhat between those attained with the lab tests. 
Recall that these values for $\rho$ are somewhat higher than those which have been used for other infield soils research (c.f. Figure \@ref(fig:lit-review-density-comparison)).
A pilot experiment was also performed to determine determine whether a notable difference in sample behavior occurred between the two energy levels.

(ref:proctor-vs-observed-infield-density-caption) For a popular commercial infield mix, dry density values observed on a professionally managed infield surface lie between those achieved with the Standard and Modified Proctor tests.


```{r proctor-vs-observed-infield-density, fig.cap='(ref:proctor-vs-observed-infield-density-caption)', fig.scap='Proctor tests compared with dry density of an actual infield', eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics('../../cleatmarkmethod/figs/pdf/proctor-vs-observed-infield-density.pdf')
```


A proctor test was performed for each sample to determine $w_{opt}$. 
A rough estimate of $w_{opt}$ was made by adding small amounts of water to a hand specimen. 
The gravimetric water content was determined and five total aliquots were prepared - one at this water content, with two drier and two wetter. 
Appropriate amounts of water were incorporated by hand to yield $w$ spacing of &asymp; 0.02. 
Samples were cured in plastic bags for &GreaterEqual; 16 hr. 
Each specimen was compacted and weighed, and a representative sample was removed for the water content determination. 

To derive $w_{opt}$, a polynomial spline was fitted to the plot of dry density vs. water content.
Values for $\rho_{max}$ and $w_{opt}$ were computed by setting the curve's derivative to zero and solving for each value at this point (Figure \@ref(fig:deriving-proctor-values)). 
<!-- This approach is further documented in **soiltestr**.  -->
@ASTMD698-12 suggests the operator draw the compaction curve manually, but a computational approach
removes operator judgement and makes the analysis more reproducible.
See @Howell1997 and @Webb2014 for other examples of fitting mathematical functions to Proctor data.


(ref:deriving-proctor-values-caption) Values for $\rho_{max}$ and $w_{opt}$ (black arrows) were derived from the compaction curves using a spline fitting routine.'

```{r deriving-proctor-values, fig.cap='(ref:deriving-proctor-values-caption)', fig.scap='Example compaction curves prior to cleat-mark test', eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics('../../cleatmarkmethod/figs/pdf/deriving-proctor-values.pdf')
```


A sufficient mass of air-dry soil was then brought to the appropriate $w_{opt}$ for the test energy.
The water was weighed and thoroughly incorporated by hand and allowed to cure for &GreaterEqual;16 hr. 


##### Conversion of Proctor test energy-per-volume to cleat-mark cylinder equivalent

A direct translation of protocols between the Proctor tests and preparation of the cleat-mark cylinders was not possible. 
The Proctor mold is 10.2 cm diameter x 11.4 cm deep while the pneumatic test device uses cylinders 15.4 cm diameter x 10.2 cm deep \@ref(fig:proctor-vs-cleat-mark-cyls-photo).
```{r proctor-vs-cleat-mark-cyls-photo, fig.cap='The cleat-mark cylinders were designed with different dimensions than a typical Proctor mold. A conversion was required to equate the compaction energy between them.', fig.scap='Proctor mold and cleat-mark cylinders'}
# add this photo when I take it
# knitr::include_graphics(...)

```

The cleat-mark cylinder dimensions were initially chosen based on two criteria: 

(1) the minimum diameter needed to accommodate several baseball cleats, and 

(2) a commonly used specification for infield soil depth (10.2 cm / 4 in)

With these dimensions, a fully-loaded cylinder containing moist soil has a mass of ~5.5 kg.
Unfortunately, it was later discovered that the automatic turntable for the 3D scanner has a maximum capacity of 5 kg. 
Therefore an adjustment to reduce the specimen mass was required. 
2.5 cm cylindrical plugs were fabricated from high-strength polymer resin poured into each cylinder (Figure \@ref(fig:resin-plugs)).
The resin has a bulk density of just ~0.6 Mg m^-3^ so the plugs reduce the total specimen mass to ~ 4.5 kg and maintain a sufficient profile depth of 7.5 cm.
After inserting the plugs, each cylinder's volume was precisely determined by filling it with de-aired water and recording the filled mass.
This procedure allows precise density computations despite any differences in the plugs' sizes. 

```{r resin-plugs, fig.cap='Low-density resin plugs used to reduce cylinder volume.'}
knitr::include_graphics('../../cleatmarkmethod/photos-and-screen-recordings/resin-plug.JPG')
```


A conversion was then developed to equate each Proctor test energy to 
the larger cleat-mark cylinder. The conversion for the Standard test 
(25 blows per layer, 3 layers) is straightforward because the new total profile thickness (3 in or 7.5 cm) corresponds exactly to 2/3 of the regular Proctor mold. 
Therefore the lift thickness was held constant and the number of lifts was simply reduced to 2. 56 blows per layer are used for the 15 cm-diameter mold @ASTMD698-12.
The Modified test calls for 5 lifts, which is not evenly divisible into the new total height.
An additional energy conversion is required to translate the Modified compaction routine to the cleat-mark cylinders.
This calculation is outlined in Equation \@ref(eq:modified-energy-per-volume).


\begin{align*} 
\frac{E_{Modified~Proctor_{total}}}{vol_{Modified~Proctor}}&=\frac{E_{cleat-mark_{total}}}{vol_{cleat-mark}} \\
\frac{2700~\frac{kJ}{m^3}}{978~cm^3}&=\frac{E_{cleat-mark_{total}}}{1537~cm^3} \\
E_{cleat-mark_{total}}&=~4243 \frac{kJ}{m^3} \\
\end{align*}

A single blow of the Modified hammer applies:

\begin{align*}
E&=mgh \\
E&=\frac{4.54~kg}{}~\times~\frac{9.81~m}{s^2}~\times~\frac{0.457~m}{} \\
E&=\frac{\frac{20.34~kgm^2}{s^2}}{\text{blow}} \\
&=\frac{20.34~J}{\text{blow}} \\
\end{align*}

Therefore a total energy of 4243 kJ requires:
\begin{equation}
\frac{4243~J}{\text{cylinder}}\times\frac{\text{1 blow}}{20.34~J}= \text{209 blows per cylinder} \\
(\#eq:modified-energy-per-volume)
\end{equation}


Split over 3 layers, $209 / 3 \approx 70$ blows per layer are required.


##### Comparison of density achieved during Proctor tests and cleat-mark compaction routine 

To validate the energy conversion outlined in Equation  \@ref(eq:modified-energy-per-volume), the masses and water contents of each cylinder were recorded following compaction.
Three replicates of two soils at both energies were prepared for a total of 12 specimens. 

These were compared with the values of $\rho_{max}$ and $w_{opt}$ derived from the original Proctor test (either standard or modified).

Figure \@ref(fig:proctor-vs-cleat-mark-achieved-density-fig) shows that the three replicates within a soil x effort pair were very consistent; the pooled standard deviation within each soil x effort combination was just `r pooled_qc_density_sd` Mg m^-3^.
Figure \@ref(fig:proctor-vs-cleat-mark-achieved-density-fig) also clearly shows that the cleat-mark compaction routine packed the soil to a similar but systematically lower dry density than the corresponding Proctor test.
This result corresponds well with prior research on varying the mold diameter during compaction tests. 
@ASTMD698-12 states:

>"Results have been found to vary slightly when a material is tested at the same compactive effort in different size molds, with the smaller mold size typically yielding larger values of density/unit weight."

@Johnson1962 reported differences of 0.05 Mg m^-3^ for a clayey sand.
This is comparable to the mean difference of `r avg_density_diff` observed in this small experiment.
Therefore it seems that the chosen compaction routine is both repeatable and of sufficient energy.

```

Full trial runs were completed using each routine for the daily specimen repairs. 
The full procedure is detailed in Section \@ref(performing-cleat-mark-test).
A single critical water content $\theta_{crit}$ was derived for each soil x effort combination using the Normalized RFI as the surface metric of interest. 
These values are summarized in \@ref(tab:derived-water-contents-from-cleat-mark-test-effort-comparison-tab).
These data suggest the compaction effort does not markedly influence the ultimate value determined for $w_{crit}$. The tests were not replicated so they cannot be statistically compared.

##### Summary - specimen compaction

Ultimately, the Modified effort was adopted for all further study for the following reasons:

1. The "critical" water contents derived from the two methods were quite similar. 
Although a statistical comparison was not possible, the differences due to soil type appears to be larger than any difference due to compaction effort. 

2. Soil bulk density on an actual infield was higher than that from a Standard Proctor test. 
The prevailing opinion among grounds managers is that the infield should be as compacted as possible. 
Therefore, a realistic lab test should favor greater rather than lesser compaction.

#### Measuring & adjusting the water content 

Wetting and drying cycles are considered an important part of conditioning an infield. 
A heavy hand-watering is usually the first action taken following grading and compaction. Evacuating air from the profile aids in settling the soil to a stable condition.
The brittle-ductile transition mostly occurs during day games when no water can be added after the game begins. 

A given soil must be tested at a range of water contents which bracket $w_{crit}$. 
The water content was adjusted up or down by adding a known volume of water or by drying under a heat lamp manifold. 
The manifold was calibrated to emulate the outdoor conditions on a summer day in the northeastern United States.
Figure \@ref(fig:heat-lamps-photo) shows the apparatus which comprises 12 regularly spaced clamp fixtures, each housing a 150-W broad-spectrum incandescent bulb (Exo-Terra PT2114 - A21/150W). 


Proper configuration of the drying apparatus was determined through a series of calibrations.
These measured the effect of lamp distance, the variability of $w$ within and across specimens, and the validity of two methods for measuring $\theta$.
These are next described. 


###### Water content study 1: Lamp distance 

In this experiment, gravimetric water content was determined in the top 15 mm using an 8 mm diameter soil probe.
Four samples were extracted each hour and averaged to produce a representative value for the surface.
The surface temperature was also recorded using an infrared laser thermometer. 
The distance between the heat bulb and the soil specimen markedly affects the drying rate. 
Figure \@ref(fig:water-content-change-by-lamp-height)A shows that a 15 cm distance caused excessively rapid drying (initially over 3 % by dry mass per hour). 
Figure \@ref(fig:water-content-change-by-lamp-height)B also shows the rate of water loss was not constant with time. 
Conversely, a 45 cm lamp height produced only a small change in water content over 3-4 hr (the typical length of a professional baseball game). 
The 30 cm distance produced the most realistic result. 

###### Water content study 2: Uniformity across specimen surface and across replicate specimens

A second experiment was performed to assess the uniformity of $w$ across the specimen surface. 
The cleat-mark test pairs a single water content value with a surface disruption measurement. 
This experiment's purpose was to establish the degree of uncertainty the water content measurement. 

As described above, $w$ was determined in the top 15 mm using an 8 mm diameter soil probe. 
A regular grid was marked on three replicate specimens. The samples were placed under the drying apparatus and a soil sample was removed at each grid intersection every 60 minutes. 
This allowed comparison of $w$ across both space and time.


Figure \@ref(fig:w-variation-across-space-and-time) shows the results for each replicate during the 6-hr drying period.
The water content is highly uniform across the surface of a single specimen, and the difference across replications is small.

```
 
Finally, the variation in water content due to time is clearly larger than any heterogeneities across an individual specimen or across replications. 
For this particular soil, the rate of water loss $\frac{\Delta w}{hr}$ was essentially linear for the first 3 hours of drying. 
After > &thickapprox; 3 hours, the rate of loss slowed.
This is a well-documented phenomenon in soil physics and often corresponds with the breaking of contunuous capillary flow [reference needed; Watson soil physics textbook]

###### Water content study 3: precise measurement of $\theta$ {#sand-replacement-vs-scanner-for-theta}
The third water content study's aim was to develop a method for measuring _volumetric_ water content $\theta$. 
Relative merits of $w$ and $\theta$ are discussed in Section \@ref(soil-water-content) and by @Brady2007. 
In the present study it is far easier to measure $w$ on the small samples available for testing. However, it is the volume of water present rather than the mass which determines the spacing of soil particles and the nature of their contacts.  
In this context the physical significance of $\theta$ is clearer and it would be prefrrable to use $\theta$ if a sufficiently accurate and precise measurement can be made. 
Also, $\theta$ is often measured in-situ on an actual infield by using time-domain reflectometry probes, and values obtained in the lab test will afford better comparison if made on a volumetric basis.
Therefore a method was sought to accurately measure $\theta$ for samples large enough to yield accurate data but small enough to avoid destroying the entire specimen. 

A small intact soil core is removed (diameter = 21mm, depth = 15 mm) using a small soil probe.
The core is ejected and immediately weighed to &plusmn; 0.001 g. 
The bottom of the core normally separates in an uneven pattern so a geometric computation
of the cylinder's volume is not adequate.
Two methods were employed to measure the volume of the plug:

(1.) Sand replacement

(2.) 3D scanning

```{r density-plug-imgs, fig.cap='Two methods for measuring the volume of a 15 mm-deep by 21 mm diameter soil plug: \\textbf{A.} Sand replacement method with a miniature plastic cone. \\textbf{B}. 3D scanning method with plug situated on a rest to provide clearance from turn table.', fig.scap='Measuring the volume of miniature soil plugs', eval=TRUE, fig.pos='bthp'}

```
Method (1) was essentially a miniaturized version of @ASTMD1556-07. 
A small plastic cone was trimmed and its volume was carefully calibrated with deaired water.
A dry sand was calibrated to  loose density of 1.54 Mg m^-3^.
These were used to fill the cavity left by the soil plug (Figure \@ref(fig:density-plug-imgs)A).
The plug volume was calculated by converting the mass of sand used to volume and subtracting the known cone volume:

\begin{align}
\quad V_{plug} &= V_{sand_{~total}} - V_{cone} \quad ; \quad V_{sand_{~total}} = \frac{m_{sand_{~total}}}{\rho_{sand}} \\
V_{plug} &= \frac{m_{sand_{~total}}}{\rho_{sand}} - V_{cone} \\
(\#eq:mini-density-sand-backfill-equation)
\end{align}

In method (2) a 3D scan of the core was recorded (Figure \@ref(fig:density-plug-imgs)B). 
3D scanning has been used to measure bulk density for irregularly-shaped soil clods [@Rossi2008]. The scanning process was similar to that described below (Section \@ref(cleat-mark-specimen-3D-scanning)).
The primary difference was that for the water content plug scan, two scans were recorded with the plug in different orientations.
This was required for all sides to be "seen" by the scanner in at least one scan. 
An additional challenge was raising the specimen above the turntable surface so it would register separately from the turntable. 
Ultimately the plug was stationed atop a #10 U.S. hex nut. This resting space provided enough clearance so the soil could be differentiated from the turntable without allowing its position to shift during the turntable's rotation. 

The volume of the `.ply` mesh was determined using the `vcgVolume()` function in the **`Rvcg`** software package for R [@Schlager2017]. 
A volumetric water content was then computed from the specimen's gravimetric water content and its dry density:

\begin{align}
\begin{split} \\
\text{Gravimetric water content:} \\ 
w &= \frac{water~loss~(g)}{m_{oven-dry~soil}~(g)} \\
\text{Dry bulk density:} \\
\rho_{dry} &= \frac{m_{oven-dry~soil}~(g)}{core~volume~(cm^3)} \\
\text{Volumetric water content:} \\
\theta  &= \rho_{dry} \times w \\
\end{split} \\
(\#eq:vwc-equation) 
\end{align}

Each of the two methods was performed for 5 replicate soil plugs on 12 prepared cleat-mark specimens.
Mean values and standard deviations were computed for each method; these data are plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:sand-backfill-vs-3D-scanner-for-volumetric-w-determination-fig) and the values are compiled in the Appendix (Table \@ref(tab:sand-backfill-vs-3D-scanner-for-volumetric-w-determination-table)).

(ref:sand-backfill-vs-3D-scanner-for-volumetric-w-determination-fig-caption) The 3D scanning method for computing the extracted plug's volume 
```{r sand-backfill-vs-3D-scanner-for-volumetric-w-determination-fig, fig.cap='(ref:sand-backfill-vs-3D-scanner-for-volumetric-w-determination-fig-caption)', eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics('../../cleatmarkmethod/figs/pdf/mini-plug-density-comp.pdf')
```
The distribution of scatter in Figure \@ref(fig:sand-backfill-vs-3D-scanner-for-volumetric-w-determination-fig) clearly shows better precision of the scanner method. 
The standard deviation of $\rho$ for a single specimen was `r sand_replacement_rho_sd` when measured with sand replacement. This standard deviation was reduced to `r scanner_rho_sd` when measured with the scanner. 
Recall that the ultimate utility of the density measurement is computing $\theta$ from $w$ and $\rho$. As an example, if the true value for $w$ is 15%, the consequence of one standard deviation of 0.07 Mg m^-3^ in the density measurement propagates to a $\theta$ error of `r round(sand_replacement_rho_sd*0.15, 3)`. This would appear an unacceptably large range if the cleat-mark analysis is to pinpoint $\theta_{crit}$ within < 1 % accuracy. 

Interestingly, the scanner method produced not just less scatter in $\rho$ but also higher mean values for 11 of the 12 cylinders. 
The average difference was `r  avg_diff_between_sand_replacement_and_scanner_rho` Mg m^-3^. Most likely the probe produces some plastic distortion of the hole's sidewalls when it is inserted and removed. This additional space is filled by sand which increases the measured volume and decreasing the computed dry density. Also, for this small sample diameter the probe's sidewalls (0.5 mm) comprise a non-negligible fraction of the total hole's volume. Again, this volume is considered part of the plug volume for the sand replacement method but not for the scanner method. The scanner method directly measures the volume of the soil plug so it more accurately represents the soil sample's true dimensions. Finally, intact core sampling is also assumed to produces some compaction in the sidewalls as the probe is driven into the surface [@Lichter1994]. However, these samples are already intentionally compacted to a high degree and this effect is probably minor. The dry density values obtained from the 3D scanning method also compare favorably with those attained in the initial Proctor tests (data not shown).

In summary, the 3D scanner method for determining $\rho$ showed good precision. Its small standard deviation of `r scanner_rho_sd` warrants the use of a single plug to represent the density of the cleat-mark specimen. Additional small gravimetric samples will be taken as these are less destructive and can be processed rapidly to further reduce the uncertainty around $\theta$.



###### Summary: measuring and adjusting water content 

A routine was developed to wet and dry the samples in a controlled manner. 
A set of heat lamps dries the surfaces uniformly across both space and time. 
Volumetric water content can be measured with good precision and accuracy with a combination of gravimetric methods and 3D scanning. 


#### Performing the test {#performing-cleat-mark-test}


There are three basic steps in the cleat-mark test:

1. Produce cleat indentations on the specimen

2. Collect a 3D scan of the surface 

3. Measure the water content and any other types of data

Each is outlined here. 


##### Cleat indentations 

The pneumatic device is first charged to 690 kPa (100 psi).
The specimen is secured into the device with adjustable clips. 
The device is manually actuated and then retracted. 
Any soil ejected from the cleat indentations is carefully removed so that the clods are not crushed by subsequent tests.
This sequence is repeated twice more, rotating the specimen by 60    &deg; after each test.
The reserved soil clods are carefully replaced at their original locations.

##### 3D scan {#cleat-mark-specimen-3D-scanning}

Six markers are placed on the rim of the aluminum sample holder (Figure \@ref(fig:scanner-markers)). 
The markers allow the scanner to register individual pointclouds and merge them into a single mesh.
A series of scans is made using a step size of 20&deg; for a total of 18 captures per specimen. 
Surface texture is not recorded as this nearly triples the scan time and does not contribute useful information during later analyses.
These are merged using EinScan's software (without scaling or reduction) and exported as a single `.ply` file.
The `.ply` format is an open file format and permits both ASCII and binary encoding. 
It was designed to be simple yet extensible: while the only requirements are a set of x, y, and z vertex coordinates and corresponding face indices, arbitrary information such as color and texture may be also be encoded directly alongside the spatial coordinates [@Turk1994].


##### Water content and ancillary data 

For each tested cylinder, representative values of $w$ and $\theta$ are determined using the procedure detailed in Section \@ref(sand-replacement-vs-scanner-for-theta).

Penetrometer resistance is measured with a handheld device having a maximum capacity of 5 kg cm^-1^. 
Four readings are averaged to produce a a representative value. 
Dry specimens reject this device and in this case peak resistance cannot be recorded. 
Visual observations on the nature of deformation are noted. 
Finally, a digital photograph of the sample is taken after the test.


#### Mesh processing pipeline 

In their raw state, the `.ply` files are of little use because the pointclouds' coordinates are relative to the scanner's detector. 
A number of cleaning and processing operations are requried in order to make the meshes suitable for measurements. 

<!-- edit this some so the tenses match, etc  -->
The raw meshes generated by the device are oriented in a coordinate system relative to the scanner's detectors (Figure \@ref(fig:orienting-and-removing-cyl-fig)A) 
Due to the specimen geometry the scans also contained incomplete fragments of the aluminum cylinders housing the soil. 
To allow meaningful comparison of the soil surfaces, the cylinder portion must be removed from the mesh and the surface must be oriented in real-world coordinates. 
These tasks may be done interactively with point-and-click software such as MeshLab [@Cignoni2008], but an interactive approach is neither scaleable nor reproducible. 


Instead, a processing routine was written using the R Language for Statistical Computing [@R-core2021]. 
This code was primarily based on the **`Rvcg`** and **`Morpho`** packages [@Schlager2017], which are in turn built atop the open-source C++ libraries maintained by the ISTI-CNR Visual Computing Lab (Pisa, Italy, <https://www.isti.cnr.it/en/>). Various functions from other packages were also leveraged [@Wickham2019, @R-circular].
<!-- This is out of place but landmark shape analysis needs to be mentioned _somewhere_ -->
<!-- Like most tools for 3D meshes, these packages are geared toward landmark shape analysis.  -->
<!-- **Landmarks** are analagous points across specimens, for example the tip of one's nose.  -->
<!-- Landmarks are usually digitized manually and used to align specimens, but there is no need for an absolute coordinate system.  -->
Briefly, a 4x4 roto-translation matrix was interactively recorded using a freshly prepared specimen. 
This 4x4 matrix was saved as an `.rda` data file and applied to each mesh using implicit loops (functionals).
Figure @ref(fig:orienting-and-removing-cyl-fig)B) shows the corrected orientation of the mesh. 

The mesh was then finely adjusted in the x-y plane based on its maximum x and y coordinate values. 
This is needed because it is impossible to place each successive specimen in an _identical_ location on the turntable. 
Next, any points greater than 70 mm from the mesh's center were removed by computing Boolean values for each vertex solved from the basic equation for a circle with origin $(0,0)$  :

\begin{align}
		\begin{split}
			(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 &= r^2 \\
			\mathrm{Since}~x=0~\mathrm{and}~y=0;~~ (x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2 &= 70^2 \\
			x^2 +y^2 &= 70^2 \\
		\end{split} 
(\#eq:cylinder-clipping-equation) 
\end{align}

Therefore for a given vertex, if $x^2+y^2>70$ the vertex was removed from the matrix of coordinates. 
This removed both the aluminum sample holder and the outer rim of the specimen's surface, leaving a disk 140 mm in diameter. 

After removing the cylinder a small adjustment was made to the mesh's z-coordinates. 
Fine-grained soil may change volume as it wets or dries.
The change is not necessarily planar; the center of the sample typically shrinks faster than the edges because water cannot flow through the cylinder walls. 
These small changes in suface elevation mean that a single rigid 4x4 matrix cannot return the "origin" of every sample to the exact coordinates $(0, 0, 0)$.
However, it could be assumed that _on average_ the elevation with the greatest frequency of points represents the elevation of the original soil surface at test time.
This assumption was used to perform the final z-adjustment.
The distribution of z-coordinates (comprising ~2.5 million points) was split into 10,000 bins. 
The most frequently occurring value was assumed to be the "true" level of z=0. 
Each point in the mesh was moved up or down by this value, depending on its sign  (Figure \@ref(fig:mesh-z-points-histogram)).

```{r mesh-z-points-histogram, fig.cap='Each vertex of the mesh was adjusted by the median elevation to further refine the position of the mesh.', fig.scap='Final adjustment of mesh z-coordinates'}
knitr::include_graphics('../../cleatmarkmethod/figs/pdf/z-histogram.pdf')
```


The final result of the orientation, cleaning, and decimation operations is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:orienting-and-removing-cyl-fig)C.
The "origin" of the mesh lies within a fraction a of a millimeter of the absolute location of $(0, 0, 0)$.
The value of this computational pipeline is emphasized in light of the long analysis times required by point-and-click alternatives, as well as reduced chance for human error. 
The entire operation is both scaleable and reproducible. 

(ref:orienting-and-removing-cyl-caption) \textbf{A.} Orientation of the raw mesh generated by 3D scanner. \textbf{B.} Orientation of the specimen after application of 4x4 roto-translation matrix. \textbf{C.} Final orientation of mesh after removing extraneous portions and performing secondary position adjustments. Junction of the three axes represents $(0,0,0)$.

```{r orienting-and-removing-cyl-fig, fig.cap = '(ref:orienting-and-removing-cyl-caption)', fig.scap='Mesh orientation and cleaning pipeline'}
knitr::include_graphics('../../cleatmarkmethod/figs/manually-built/processing-pipeline-panel.png')
```

The final step in the cleaning operation is to reduce the size of the mesh. 
Landscape-scale research has shown that large pointclouds often have resolution exceeding that required for robust analyses [@Brubaker2013]. 
In such a case it is pragmatic to reduce the file sizes in order to improve computational efficiency. 
A decimating "titration" was performed on several meshes to determine the minimum number of faces required to maintain adequate surface detail.
Figure \@ref(fig:decimation-titration-surface-area) shows that for a raw mesh file with > 3 million faces, no loss in surface area occurred until the mesh was reduced to &thickapprox;250,000 faces. 
A face number of 500,000 was chosen as a factor of safety.


#### Surface perormance metrics 

Several measurements have been developed to ennumerate the degree of disturbance to the soil surface after testing.
All are conceptually referenced to an undisturbed soil surface of the same radius, lying in the $(x, y)$ plane. 

The measurements are grouped into three categories:

1. Volume of disturbed soil

Effectively these are the "cut" or "fill" required to return the tested sample to its originally planar state. Several algorithms were developed to compute these values from the pointcloud (voxel re-sampling, )

2. Normalized Relief Index (NRFI)

This is the simplest of the measurements - it is a normalized ratio of the actual surface area of the triangluar mesh to its 2D footprint. The surface area of the reference plane is subtracted and the result is multiplied by 100 to make the values simpler to compare. NRFI is essentially the percent gain in surface area for the tested specimen over its undisturbed equivalent. The formula is: 

\begin{equation}
NRFI = \left(\frac{\text{surface area}_{\text{ total}}}{\pi~r^2} - \pi~r^2 \right) \times 100 \\
(\#eq:nrfi-equation) 
\end{equation}


3. Dirichlet Normal Energy (DNE)

Dirichlet Normal Energy is a relatively morphometric used in anthropology and biology. It is a measure of the total curvature of a surface. Briefly, the vertex normals of each point are averaged ....See @Pampush2016 and @Bunn2011 for a more complete treatment of DNE.

#### Determination of $\theta_{crit}$

The goal of the cleat-mark test is to identify a single water content where the soil exhibits an abrupt change between brittle and ductile behavior. In reality the brittle-ductile transition occurs somewhat more gradually. However, for assessment of infield mixes, a threshold water content is required and the transition is sufficiently abrupt to assign a single value.  

Each surface metric was plotted against volumetric water content.
Figure \@ref(fig:example-nfri-vs-water-content-curve) shows an example curve. 
A third-order polynomial regression was fitted to the data.
The critical water content $\theta_{crit}$ was identified as the first local minimum as the soil moves from wet to dry (right to left on Figure \@ref(fig:example-nfri-vs-water-content-curve)).

(ref:example-nfri-vs-water-content-curve) An example of the characteristic water contents used to derive $\theta_{crit}$. Water contents above A generally yield little additional surface area. Water content B represents the state in which the soil is most 'vulnerable' to fragmentation. As water content reduces further toward point C, the soil hardens and the cleats are less able to penetrate the surface. 

```{r example-nfri-vs-water-content-curve, fig.cap='(ref:example-nfri-vs-water-content-curve)', fig.scap='Conceptual stages of infield soil behavior with reducing $\\theta$'}

knitr::include_graphics('./figs/pdf/example-w-crit-curve.pdf')

```


The choice of this point as $\theta_{crit}$ warrants a brief discussion behind the physical meaning of the curve's shape.

For this discussion NFRI is referenced as the metric of choice, but the general shape of the relationship is similar for other metrics.

When the soil is very wet, the device easily actuates to the full extent afforded by its geometry. 
Further increases in the water content can only produce a marginally greater disruption to the specimen. The NRFI vs. $\theta$ curve is relatively flat. 

At lower water contents, disturbance is relatively constant because no soil is removed or fractured from the surface. 
Any new surface area is governed purely by the shape of the cleats. 
This is an ideal state from the perspective of the grounds manager. 

When the soil reaches $\theta_{crit}$ it begins to fragment into discrete pieces as the cleats penetrate the surface. 

As the soil continues to dry, brittleness is maximized and the soil forms larger chips and clods. 
These may fragment further which produces additonal surface area. 

A possible complication not depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:example-nfri-vs-water-content-curve) is that with further decreases in water content the soil becomes so hard that NFRI falls below its value at $\theta_{crit}$.
Although NFRI is nominally lower in this state, the soil is in an undesirable condition because of its high strength.
Ball response will be erratic and players can incur injuries due to extreme surface hardness.
For this reason, any points drier than the local maximum marked as point (B) in Figure \@ref(fig:example-nfri-vs-water-content-curve) are discarded prior to optimizing the curve to derive $\theta_{crit}$.


#### Summary: cleat-mark method 

- The method described above provides an objective means to choose a single water content for any infield soil. This value is termed $\theta_{crit}$.

- $\theta_{crit}$ is considered the lower boundary of the water contents suitable for play.

- A standard routine was adopted for building and repairing the soil specimens. The routine uses techniques similar to those empolyed on actual infields, including the Modified Proctor hammer and a drying apparatus to emulate natural sunlight. 

- It is recognized that the shape of the disturbance metric vs. water content curve may not be equivalent for all soils. The curve-fitting routine merits further study.


### Timeline 

The device was designed and fabricated in spring 2020. Calibration and tuning of the 3D scanner began July of 2020. The method described above has been tested on multiple soils. The final step will be to perform an error analysis across replicate soil specimens. 


## Paper 2: Applying the cleat-in, cleat-out method

Paper title: **Identifying the brittle-ductile transition of infield soil mixtures subjected to disturbance by baseball cleats**

### Overview 

This paper is the first chance to apply the method described in Section \@ref(cleatmark-method-development-chapter).

### Principal research questions

1. How does clay type interact with sand content to determine the critical water content where the soil changes from cleat-in/cleat-out behavior to clod-forming failure?

2. Do Atterberg limit tests correlate with the critical water contents?

3. For a given clay soil, what is the critical sand content above which the cleat-in/cleat-out surface cannot be achieved?

### Hypotheses



### Materials and Methods

This paper consists of three separate experiments. They are designed to test the effect of:

1. **Varying sand content:** Five fine-grained soils will be mixed with a single sand in ratios ranging from 0-100% sand.^[Soils having no sand-size particles are rare; the 0% is stated here allegorically to indicate the 'pure' clay soil with no added sand.] Sand contents will be clustered around the transitional fines content to help identify the critical behavioral threshold for each clay type (see Figure \@ref(fig:sand-content-clustering)). This is preferred to simply testing mixes with equally-spaced sand contents, because the behavior change is nearly linear up to the transitional fines content.

```{r sand-content-clustering, fig.cap='The sand contents for Experiment 1 in Chapter 2 will be deliberately clustered around the transitional fines content to provide the best data resolution', fig.scap='Clustering of sand contents for best data resolution', eval=TRUE}
source('supplemental_R_scripts/clustered_sand_contents.R')
sand_pcts_to_choose

```


2. **Varying silt-to-clay ratio:** The same fine-grained soils from (1) will each be separately mixed with quartz silt to produce soil mixtures having identical silt-to-clay ratios (SCR) but containing different clay minerals. These soils will be further mixed with sand to produce mixtures of either 60 or 70% sand. The target SCR values will be 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4, but some of the clays already contain too much silt to be tested at the lower SCR values. These soils would simply be tested at any ratios they are capable of meeting (Table \@ref(tab:planned-scr-values)).

```{r planned-scr-values, eval=TRUE}

scr_possible_vals <- tibble::tibble(
  `Clay name` = c('Calcium montmorillonite', 'mixed-layer/illite-dominated', 'fine-grained kaolinite', 'sesquioxide-rich', 'high-silt soil'),
  clay_pct = c(0.6, 0.5, 0.8, 0.8, 0.1),
  silt_pct = 1- clay_pct,
  scr = round(silt_pct / clay_pct, 2)
  ) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(
    `% clay-size` = clay_pct,
    `% silt-size` = silt_pct,
    `Silt-to-clay ratio` = scr
  )

scr_possible_vals %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl(align = 'lccc',
                  booktabs = TRUE,
                  digits = 2,
                caption = 'The 5 soils from Experiment 1 have different silt-to-clay ratios; silt can be added to produce soils with equivalent SCR values but different clay minerals and clay particle sizes. High-silt soils cannot be tested at an SCR lower than their existing value.',
                caption.short = 'Adjusted silt-to-clay ratios of "pure" clays') %>% 
  kableExtra::row_spec(0, bold = TRUE) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
  
```


3. **Varying sand type:** Two of the clays from Experiment (1) will be chosen based on having high and low toughness. They will be mixed with 4 types of sand at 4 sand contents (50, 60, 70, and 75%) for a total of 32 mixes. The sand types include a "coarse", "medium" and "fine" with similar uniformity coefficients (Cu) and a sand having similar D<sub>50</sub> to the "medium" sand. This design allows a comparison of both size and uniformity to be made for a both low- and high-toughness clays.



### Timeline 



## Paper 3: Toughness of sand-clay mixtures

Paper title: **Toughness-water content relations of clay soils via unconfined compression testing**

### Overview 

Infield soils have two critical water contents that define the range of acceptable consistency. The lower boundary is defined by the cleat-in,cleat-out effect. Chapters 1 and 2 address the lower boundary. 

The upper boundary of water content is governed by toughness and shear strength. 
Although much emphasis has been made on the cleat-in, cleat-out effect, this upper boundary of water content has weightier implications because above this water content the game simply cannot be played. 
Section \@ref(importance-of-the-infield) described the financial and scheduling implications of postponements. 

This paper is the compliment to Section \@ref(cleatmark-method-development-chapter). 
Its goal is to create a new way to use already-established tests for measuring the toughness of soil mixtures. 
These data can establish both ends of the water content spectrum for a given soil. 

### Principal research questions

1. Can soil toughness be measured using unconfined compression tests?

2. How does toughness change as a function of water content for different types of clay soils?

3. How does the toughness-water content relationship change as sand is added to the clays?

### Hypotheses

1. Soil toughness can be measured with unconfined compression tests. By testing both specimens dry and wet of the plastic limit, one can interpolate their maximum toughness, which occurs at the plastic limit (i.e. onset of brittle fracturing).

2. Higher plasticity soils will have less change in toughness for a unit change in water content. The maximum toughness of the clay types will be in order of montmorillonite >> mixed-layer/illite > kaolinite > iron-oxide rich > high-silt soil. 

3. Clays with higher maximum toughness will require more sand to reduce their toughness. Because they maintain similar toughness over a broader range of water content, the behavior of the soil is less affected by sand additions.

### Materials and Methods

Recall that toughness is computed as the total energy dissipated by a loading procedure up to failure (Section \@ref(toughness-definitions)). 
In a hypothetical sense any test which applies a known load and measures a deformation could be used to measure toughness. 
@Barnes2013 suggested his apparatus would correlate well with the Moisture Condition Value test, which is the logarithm of the number of blows needed to compact a fixed mass of soil to a pre-determined volume.

This study will attempt to use an established machine test, the unconfined compression test (UCS).
This test is often utilized for compacted clay specimens, but in most cases the only parameter of interest is peak strength at failure.
However the test also allows stress-strain measurements to be recoreded throughout the test, and it is trivial to compute toughness from these data. 

The same mixtures tested in Chapter \@ref(cleatmark-method-development-chapter) will be used for this study. 

The soils will be wetted to their adhesion limit and packed into a 5-cm diameter steel tube with a dynamic compaction effort of 2,700 kN-m m^3^ (equivalent to the ASTM modified Proctor compaction test, D1557-12e1 [-@ASTMD15572015]. 
The soil will be packed in a single lift to minimize heterogeneities in the specimen which could arise due to lack of binding between successive lifts. 
Preparing the specimens in a relatively soft condition also ensures minimal air entrapment. 
For each mixture, 6 replicate cylinders will be prepared. 

The specimens will be extruded with a manual hydraulic bottle jack (Figure \@ref(fig:proctor-extruder)). 
One specimen will be immediately sealed in an air-tight plastic bag. 
The rest will be slowly air dried under a loose polyethylene sheet. 
Each specimen will be dried to progressively lower water contents and sealed in a plastic bag until testing, with the final specimen being completely air-dried. 
The goal is to evaluate at least 3 water contents where ductile behavior is observed and at least 2 samples where brittle behavior is observed.
This will allow the maximum toughness value to be bracketed by the tests and a curve to be fit on a plot of toughness vs. water content.

```{r proctor-extruder, fig.cap='Bottle jack specimen extruder for preparing compression test specimens.', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/gilson_stock_proctor_extruder_photo.jpg')
```


The specimens will be subjected to unconfined compression tests at the Penn State Civil Infrastructure Testing and Evaluation Laboratory. 
Axial strain and nominal stress will be recorded up to 20% strain or an abrupt failure criterion [@ASTMD2166M-13]. 
The water content of the specimen will then be determined.  

A smooth curve will be fitted to the stress-strain curve using general additive models in the R language for statistical computing [@R-core2021]. 
Toughness will be computed as the definite integral up to failure. An arbitrary failure criterion (i.e. maximum acceptable strain) will be chosen for the ductile specimens; this depends on the degree of acceptable deformation by the groundskeeper and has not yet been calculated. 

Toughness will be plotted against water content. 
It is anticipated that this relationsip will follow a bi-linear or semi-logarithmic shape, as for the Barnes apparatus [@Barnes2013]. 
Figure \@ref(fig:barnes-toughness-vs-water-content-example-plot) shows such a plot. 

```{r barnes-toughness-vs-water-content-example-plot, fig.cap='Toughness $T$ of London clay as a function of water content (from Barnes, 2013)', fig.scap='Example toughness vs. $w$ plot from Barnes (2013)'}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/barnes-example-toughness-vs-w-plot.png')
```


Finally, the coefficients from the toughness-water content relationship for each sample can be analyzed as a function of sand content and clay type. 
This two-way ANOVA will permit the toughness slope to be computed for any soil based on its initial toughness. 

### Timeline 

These tests will be completed beginning in Fall 2021 and continue through April of 2022. 


## Paper 4: Oversize partcles in Atterberg limit tests {#oversize-particles-atterberg-limits-experiment}

Paper title: **Effect of oversize particles on Atterberg limits of artificial sand-clay mixtures **

### Principal research questions

1. Can Atterberg limit tests be performed when sand particles up to 2 mm sieve diameter are included in a soil?

2. What is the effect of using coarser or finer sand?

3. What is the effect of sand uniformity?

### Hypotheses

1. The tests can be performed using identical methodology to ASTM D4318 with the 425 &mu;m washing step eliminated

1. The liquid limit will be lower for coarser sands due to reduced particle surface area.

1. Coarser sand will cause greater particle interference in the plastic limit thread as it nears its 3.2 mm diameter. The thread will crumble prematurely, raising the plastic limit value.

1. The combined effect of (2) and (3) will yield a smaller plasticity index for coarser sand. 

1.The results of the experiment can be used to apply a correction for the presence of oversize particles without their removal prior to testing. 

### Materials and Methods 

Three separate experiments will be performed.
Each will mix two or more sands with the same clay at various sand %.
The three experiments are:

1. Five sands of different size but similar $C_u$

1. Two sands with same $D_{50} and $$C_u$ but different roundness

1. Two sands with similar $D_{50}$ but different $C_u$ 


### Timeline 

I started this experiment during the COVID-19 "work-from-home" period. 
Atterberg limits were the only lab tests I could realistically complete from my house. 
I finished collecting the data over the past winter. 

I have begun analyzing the data and writing the manuscript.
I plan to submit to the Soil Science Society Journal in fall of 2021. 

## Paper 5: Putting it all together

Paper title: **A rational basis for the design of soil mixtures used on baseball and softball infields**


### Principal research questions 

1. How can better infield mixes be designed?

2. How can the performance of an existing mix be improved without replacing it?

3. What criteria best relate to infield performance, defined as the range of water contents where the soil is both plastic and stiff enough to support athletic maneuvers?

### Hypotheses 

1. Infield mix design should start with the toughness of an available clay soil, not the final sand %.

2. The level of play and maintenance budget will dictate the desired toughness level. 

3. The upper bound of the amount of clay soil component that should be included in the mix is a function of the dry shear strength of the mix because it is this property that governs the workability of the mix (i.e. the ability to groom it with implements and hand tools).

4. If a given toughness level is desired, the % sand needed to achieve this can be computed from empirical equations.

5. Ideally, toughness should be directly measured when designing a new mix; however it can also be estimated from an empirical correlation with the Atterberg limits

6. Particle size analysis is acceptable for quality control purposes, but not for design. Only once a desired blend of a particular sand with a particular clay is established through toughness testing can a definite ratio of sand-size particles to fines be defined for that mix. 

7. Amending existing soils should be done on the basis of plastictity rather than silt-to-clay ratio. The resulting mixture's properties will not be a linear interpolation between the two; thus a calibration of Atterberg limit results may be required by making several mixtures (for example 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% of soil A with the implied amount of soil B) to determine the proper amendment ratio.


### Materials and Methods 

This paper is primarily a synthesis of the methods papers described above. It will combine the methods into a single framework for designing infield mixes. Simple metrics will be defined, and the framework will be tested by using materials which were _not_ tested in the other experiments to validate the theory's merit. 

### Timeline 

This is the final paper I will write as it encompasses all the lab work and other publications. I anticipate writing it in the second half of 2022.
