This section details the planned research, much of which has already begun. Figure __
<!-- \@ref(fig:gantt-chart)  -->
outlines envisaged timelines for these experiments. Many of the tests will be performed on the same soil mixtures and the experiments, while treated separately, have substantial overlap. Therefore the testing program will be structured to minimize bottlenecks. In other words, multiple experiments will be in progress at a given time because some of the protocols involve wait times (i.e. for several hours or overnight) during which other lab tasks can be performed.


## Dissertation chapter 1: A alaboratory method for measuring surface deformation of baseball and softball infield skin soils {#cleatmark-method-development-chapter}

### Principal research questions
1. Can differences among infield mixes be observed in a laboratory test without using human subjects?
2. How can "performance" be quantified? 
3. How can the method be made objective and repeatable?

### Hypotheses
1. The "cleat-in, cleat-out" phenomenon (described in Section \@ref(#corkboard-effect)) can be duplicated using a machine and a laboratory-sized soil specimen. 
2. The means by which the soil specimen is prepared will affect the test result. Therefore, a protocol must be developed which adequately emulates the real procedures used for construction and maintenance of infield skins. The method must also simulate outdoor conditions to adjust the soil water content.  
3. Subjectivity can be minimized by relying on 3D scanning technology to measure the response of the soil. 
4. For a given soil, a critical water content threshold can be identified where disruption of the surface is minimized.
5. The obtained water content from (4) will be similar across multiple surface metrics (i.e. volume change, surface area, curvature).

### Materials and Methods

A mechanical apparatus has been developed to emulate a baseball or softball athlete's foot-to-surface interaction (Figure \@ref(fig:cleat-mark-device)). The device was designed and fabricated in spring of 2020 by the Penn State State Engineering Services Shop. 

```{r cleat-mark-device, fig.cap="Left: The pneumatic apparatus used to simulate foot-to-surface interaction. Right: A typical 9-spike baseball cleat pattern.", fig.show="hold", fig.height=3, out.width="50%"}

knitr::include_graphics('images/cleatmark_device.png')
knitr::include_graphics('images/nine-spike-pattern-compressed.png') 

```


The apparatus comprises a pneumatic cylinder charged with a benchtop air compressor. Pneumatic power was chosen for its combination of high travel speed with good control of the peak load. 

Several pilot experiments were performed to develop an optimal procedure for testing a given soil mixture. There are four main steps in the test: 

1. Prepare the soil specimen
2. Produce cleat indentations with the apparatus
3. Record a 3D mesh of the tested specimen
4. Derive surface properties from the mesh

Each step was individually scrutinized. Investigated parameters include:

**Sample preparation**:
- compaction energy (standard vs. modified Proctor routine)
- drydown apparatus (heat lamp wattage, distance, duration)
- timing of water additions and repairs

**Device operation:**
- loading pressure 
- number of cleats
- orientation of cleats
- torsion angle

**Scanner configuration**:
- angle from horizontal
- distance from specimen
- rotational step size 

**Morphometric analysis**:
- cleaning and orientation adjustments
- pointcloud reduction (decimation)
- comparison of derived morphometrics


#### Method overview

This sub-section is a high-level description of the method, from creating a soil mixture to a final result. 


##### Producing the mix

Modern infield soils are blended from two components - a (nearly) pure sand, and a fine-grained soil. 
Mixes are often categorized on the basis of their total sand-size content. 
For the purpose of simplicity, this sub-section refers to the two mixture components as "sand" and "clay", and temporarily ignores these terms' important particle-size and mineralogical connotations (see {#definition-of-terms}. 
Nearly all "sands" have a measurable quantity of particles <2&mu;m sieve diameter, and nearly all "clays" have a measurable quantity of particles >50 &mu;m.^[the lower boundary of sand-size particles as defined by USDA classification system [@USDA1999]  ]
To produce a mixture having $S$% percent sand-size particles by oven-dry mass requires knowledge of:
  - the fines content of the "sand" 
  - the sand content of the "fines" 
  - the extant gravimetric water content $w$ of each component. 

Computing the air-dry masses of each soil then requires a solution to a basic 2-member system of equations as derived below:

Variables are defined as:

- $S_{final}$: the final mixture's sand percentage as a decimal - $S_{sand}$: mass fraction of the "sand" > 53 &mu;m as a decimal.

- $S_{clay}$: mass fraction of the "clay" > 53 &mu;m as a decimal

- Note that because $S_{ sand}$ and $S_{clayey}$ are referenced to different soils, $S_{sand}~+~S_{clay}~\neq~S_{final}$

- $m_{sand}$: oven-dry mass fraction of the "sand" _as added to the final mixture_

- $m_{clay}$: oven-dry mass fraction of the "clay" _as added to the final mixture_

- $m_{final}$: the total oven-dry mass of the final mixture, equal to unity.

- $w$: gravimetric water content of a soil, normalized to the oven-dry soil solids, in decimal form.


The total oven-dry mass of the mixture is equal to unity; therefore the clay mass can be solved as a function of the sand mass:
\begin{align*}
m_{final} = m_{sand} + m_{clay} &= 1 \\
m_{clay} &= 1 - m_{ sand} \\
\end{align*}

The percent > 53 &mum; (i.e. sand-size) of the final mixture is a weighted average between the oven-dry sand-size percentages extant in each component and the masses of each component used to make the mixture:

$$S_{final} = (~m_{sand}~\cdot~S_{sand})~+~(~m_{clay}~\cdot~S_{clay})$$
Substituting for $m_{clay}$, we obtain


$$S_{final} = (~m_{sand}~\cdot~S_{sand})~+~\left[(1-m_{sand}~)\cdot~S_{clay}~\right]$$ 


Which can be distributed and rearranged to isolate $m_{sand}$:

\begin{align*}
S_{final} - S_{clay} &= ( m_{sand} \cdot S_{sand}) - (m_{sand} \cdot S_{clay}) \\ 
S_{final}  -S_{clay} &= m_{sand}\cdot( S_{sand} - S_{clay}) \\
m_{sand} &= \frac{S_f - S_{clay}}{S_{sand} - S_{clay}}\\
\end{align*}

Each oven-dry component mass is then corrected for its respective hygroscopic water content and scaled to the desired final mixture mass:

\begin{align}
m_{sand (air-dry)} &= m_{sand}\cdot (1+w) \\
\text{Sand~mass~(kg)} &= \frac{S_{clay}-S_{clay}}{S_{sand} - S_{clay}} \cdot (1+w_{sand }) \cdot m_{total~mixture~(kg)} \\
(\#eq:sand-clay-ratios)
\end{align}

For example, assume the "sand" component is 96% sand-size, the "clay" is 8% sand-size, and 50 kg of oven-dry final mix is required.
The water content of the sandy component is 0.2%, i.e. 0.002, and the gravimetric water content of the clayey component is 1.9%, i.e. 0.019.


Plugging these values into the equations gives an air-dry sandy component mass of `r round((0.6-0.08)/(0.96-0.08)*43*1.002, 2)` kg.


$$\left(\frac{0.60~-~0.08}{0.96~-~0.08}\right)~\times~(1+0.002)~\times43~kg~=~25.46~kg$$


To make these calculations efficient and reproducible, the above forumlae have been compiled into a set of functions in the R Language for Statistical Computing.


#### Preparing the specimen

An important consideration in this test's development is accurately simulating the conditions encountered on actual infields. 
As noted in Section {#}, infield soils are intentionally compacted to extremely high densities.
The infield also undergoes frequent wetting and drying cycles. These affect soil water potential and may also induce volume change.

A sample preparation routine was developed using two main criteria:

1. Emulate the conditions found on actual infields 
2. Reduce operator-dependence by using standardized protocols for initial compaction and subsequent repairs

Soils of varying grain size and plasticity exhibit differnt behavior under compaction. Rather than  compacting all samples to the same dry density, it was deemed more approproate to compact each sample at its respective optimum water content ($w_{opt}$). Therefore, a compaction test was required _prior_to any sample construction for actual cleat-mark testing. 
The two most widely-used compaction tests are the Standard and Modified Proctor tests, designated by @ASTMD698-12 and @ASTMd15572015.
The equipment used to compact infield soils is generally smaller than that used for larger earthworks projects. 

It is not immediately clear which Proctor test corresponds better to infield soil construction. Unfortunately there is no straightforward conversion between equipment size used in the field and the compaction energy applied during a laboratory test. 
@Selig1971 provided a formula for a simple case of towing a cylindrical drum towed across the soil surface, but this type of equipment is rarely used on infields and the calculation depends highly on the coefficient of rolling resistance which varies widely. An analytical solution is not necessarily required. In fact, the impact energies employed by both flavors of Proctor test were established by simply comparing the test results with  densities observed in actual earthworks projects [@Proctor1932; @Holtz2010] . 
A similar approach was taken for this study. 
Compaction tests were performed were performed on selected soils at both efforts.
The results indicate the Modified test more closely matches the density values achieved during construction of actual infield surfaces (Figure \@ref(fig:duraedge-standard-vs-modified).
A pilot experiment was also performed to determine determine whether a a notable difference in sample behavior occurred between the two energy levels.


A proctor test was performed for each sample to determine the proper water content for compaction into the custom cleat-mark cylinders. 
A rough estimate of $w_{opt}$ was made by adding small amounts of water to a hand specimen. 
The gravimetric water content was determined and five total aliquots were prepared - one at this water content, with two drier and two wetter. 
Appropriate amounts of water were incorporated by hand to yield $w$ spacing of ~0.02. 
Samples were cured in plastic bags for &GreaterEqual; 16 hr. 
Each specimen was compacted and weighed, and a representative sample was removed for the water content determination. 
To derive $w_{opt}$, a polynomial spline was fitted to the plot of dry density vs. water content.
The function's first derivative was set to zero and the $\rho_{max}$ and $w_{opt}$ values were computed by setting the curve's derivative to zero and interpolating at this point (Figure \@ref(fig:deriving-proctor-values). 
<!-- This approach is further documented in **soiltestr**.  -->
@ASTMD698-12 suggests the operator draw the compaction curve manually, but a computational approach
removes operator judgement and makes the analysis more reproducible.
See @Howell1997 and @Webb2014 for other examples of fitting mathematical functions to Proctor data.


<!-- (ref:deriving-proctor-values-caption) Values for $\\rho_{max}$ and $w_{opt}$ (black arrows) were derived from the compaction curves using a spline fitting routuine.' -->

```{r deriving-proctor-values, fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics('imported-figures/deriving-proctor-values.pdf')
```


A sufficient mass of air-dry soil was then brought to the appropriate $w_{opt}$ for the test energy.
The water was weighed and thoroughly incorporated by hand and allowed to cure for &GreaterEqual;16 hr. 


##### Conversion of Proctor test energy-per-volume to cleat-mark cylinder equivalent

Due to the design of the pneumatic device, a direct protocol translation between the Proctor mold and the cleat-mark cylinders was not possible.
The Proctor mold is 10.2 cm diameter x 11.4 cm deep.
The pneumatic test device was designed to hold cylinders with a 10.2 cm (4 in) deep soil profile. 
This is a commonly used specification for infield construction. 
At this depth, a fully-loaded cylinder containing moist soil has a mass of ~5.5 kg.
Unfortunately, the automatic turntable for the 3D scanner has a maximum capacity of 5 kg and a means to reduce the specimen mass was required. 
2.5 cm cylindrical plugs were fabricated from high-strength polymer resin poured into each cylinder \@ref(fig:resin-plugs).
The resin has a bulk density of just ~0.6 Mg m^-3^ so the plugs reduce the total specimen mass to ~ 4.5 kg while maintaining a profile depth of 7.5 cm. 
After inserting the plugs, each cylinder's volume was precisely determined by filling it with de-aired water and recording the filled mass.
This procedure allows precise density computations despite any differences in the plugs' sizes. 
A conversion was then developed to equate eac Proctor test energy to 
the larger cleat mark cylinder. The conversion for the Standard test 
(25 blows per layer, 3 layers) is straightforward because the new total profile thickness (3 in or 7.5 cm) corresponds exactly to 2/3 of the regular Proctor mold. 
Therefore the lift thickness is held constant and the number of lifts is simply reduced to 2. 56 blows per layer are used for the 15 cm-diameter mold. 
The Modified test calls for 5 lifts, which is not evenly divisible into the new total height.
An additional energy conversion is required to translate the Modified compaction routine to the cleat-mark cylinders.
This calculation is outlined in Equation \@ref(eq:modified-energy-per-volume).


\begin{align*} 
\frac{E_{Modified~Proctor_{total}}}{vol_{Modified~Proctor}}&=\frac{E_{cleat-mark_{total}}}{vol_{cleat-mark}} \\
\frac{2700~\frac{kJ}{m^3}}{978~cm^3}&=\frac{E_{cleat-mark_{total}}}{1537~cm^3} \\
E_{cleat-mark_{total}}&=~4243 \frac{kJ}{m^3} \\
\end{align*}

A single blow of the Modified hammer applies:

\begin{align*}
E&=mgh \\
E&=\frac{4.54~kg}{}~\times~\frac{9.81~m}{s^2}~\times~\frac{0.457~m}{} \\
E&=\frac{\frac{20.34~kgm^2}{s^2}}{\text{blow}} \\
&=\frac{20.34~J}{\text{blow}} \\
\end{align*}

Therefore a total energy of 4243 kJ requires:

\begin{equation}
\frac{4243~J}{\text{cylinder}}\times\frac{1~\text{blow}}{20.34~J}=209~\text{blows per cylinder} \\
(\#eq:modified-energy-per-volume)
\end{equation}

Split over 3 layers, $209 / 3 \approx 70$ blows per layer are required.


##### Comparison of density achieved during Proctor tests and cleat-mark compaction routine 

To validate the energy conversion outlined in \@ref(eq:modified-energy-per-volume), the masses and water contents of each cylinder were recorded following compaction.
Three replicates of two soils at both energies were prepared for a total of 12 specimens. 

These were compared with the values of &rho;~max~ and w~opt~ derived from the original Proctor test (either standard or modified).

Three replicated specimens were prepared from two soils. 
Figure \@ref(fig:proctor-vs-cleat-mark-achieved-density-fig) shows that the three replicates have very similar dry densities and that the cleat-mark compaction routine packed them to a slightly lower dry density than the Modified test.
This result corresponds well with prior research on varying the mold diameter of compaction tests. 
@ASTMD698-12e1 states:

>"Results have been found to vary slightly when a material is tested at the same compactive effort in different size molds, with the smaller mold size typically yielding larger values of density/unit weight."

@Johnson1962 reported differences of 0.05 Mg m^-3^ for a clayey sand.
Therefore it seems that the chosen compaction routine is both repeatable and sufficiently adequate.




##### Summary - specimen preparation 



Additionally, full trial runs were completed using each routine for the daily specimen repairs. 
No obvious difference was detected between the two efforts. 
Therefore, the Modified effort was adopted for all further study. 



#### Operating the device

### Timeline 

The device was designed and fabricated in spring 2020. Calibration and tuning of the 3D scanner began July of 2020. The method is nearly complete and the final step will be to perform an error analysis across replicate soil specimens. 


## Dissertation chapter 2: Identifying the brittle-ductile transition of infield soil mixtures subjected to disturbance by baseball cleats


### Principal research questions

1. How does clay type interact with sand content to determine the critical water content where the soil changes from cleat-in/cleat-out behavior to clod-forming failure?
2. Do Atterberg limit tests correlate with the critical water contents?
3. For a given clay soil, what is the critical sand content above which the cleat-in/cleat-out surface cannot be achieved?

### Hypotheses



### Materials and Methods

This paper consists of three separate experiments. They are designed to test the effect of:

1. **Varying sand content:** Five fine-grained soils will be mixed with a single sand in ratios ranging from 0-100% sand.^[Soils having no sand-size particles are rare; the 0% is stated here allegorically to indicate the 'pure' clay soil with no added sand.] Sand contents will be clustered around the transitional fines content to help identify the critical behavioral threshold for each clay type (see Figure \@ref(fig:sand-content-clustering)). This is preferred to simply testing mixes with equally-spaced sand contents, because the behavior change is nearly linear up to the transitional fines content.

```{r sand-content-clustering, fig.cap='The sand contents for Experiment 1 in Chapter 2 will be deliberately clustered around the transitional fines content to provide the best data resolution'}
source('supplemental_R_scripts/clustered_sand_contents.R')
sand_pcts_to_choose

```


2. **Varying silt-to-clay ratio:** The same fine-grained soils from (1) will each be separately mixed with quartz silt to produce soil mixtures having identical silt-to-clay ratios (SCR) but containing different clay minerals. These soils will be further mixed with sand to produce mixtures of either 60 or 70% sand. The target SCR values will be 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4, but some of the clays already contain too much silt to be tested at the lower SCR values. These soils would simply be tested at any ratios they are capable of meeting (Table \@ref(tab:planned-scr-values)).

```{r planned-scr-values}

scr_possible_vals <- tibble::tibble(
  `Clay name` = c('Calcium montmorillonite', 'mixed-layer/illite-dominated', 'fine-grained kaolinite', 'sesquioxide-rich', 'high-silt soil'),
  clay_pct = c(0.6, 0.5, 0.8, 0.8, 0.1),
  silt_pct = 1- clay_pct,
  scr = round(silt_pct / clay_pct, 2)
  ) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(
    `% clay-size` = clay_pct,
    `% silt-size` = silt_pct,
    `Silt-to-clay ratio` = scr
  )

scr_possible_vals %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl(align = 'lccc',
                  caption = 'The 5 soils from Experiment 1 have different silt-to-clay ratios; silt can be added to produce soils with equivalent SCR values but different clay minerals and clay particle sizes. High-silt soils cannot be tested at an SCR lower than their existing value.') %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
  
```


3. **Varying sand type:** Two of the clays from Experiment (1) will be chosen based on having high and low toughness. They will be mixed with 4 types of sand at 4 sand contents (50, 60, 70, and 75%) for a total of 32 mixes. The sand types include a "coarse", "medium" and "fine" with similar uniformity coefficients (Cu) and a sand having similar D<sub>50</sub> to the "medium" sand. This design allows a comparison of both size and uniformity to be made for a both low- and high-toughness clays.



### Timeline 



## Dissertation chapter 3: Toughness-water content relations of clay soils via unconfined compression testing

In the hypothetical sense any test which applies a known load and measures a deformation could be used to measure toughness. @Barnes2013 suggested his apparatus would correlate well with the Moisture Condition Value test, which is the logarithm of the number of blows needed to compact a fixed mass of soil to a pre-determined volume.



### Principal research questions

1. Can soil toughness be measured using unconfined compression tests?

2. How does toughness change as a function of water content for different types of clay soils?

3. How does the toughness-water content relationship change as sand is added to the clays?

### Hypotheses

1. Soil toughness can be measured with unconfined compression tests. By testing both specimens dry and wet of the plastic limit, one can interpolate their maximum toughness, which occurs at the plastic limit (i.e. onset of brittle fracturing).

2. Higher plasticity soils will have less change in toughness for a unit change in water content. The maximum toughness of the clay types will be in order of montmorillonite >> mixed-layer/illite > kaolinite > iron-oxide rich > high-silt soil. 

3. Clays with higher maximum toughness will require more sand to reduce their toughness. Because they maintain similar toughness over a broader range of water content, the behavior of the soil is less affected by sand additions.

### Materials and Methods

The same mixtures tested in [Chapter 1](#cleatmark-method-development-chapter) will be used for this study. 

The soils will be wetted to their adhesion limit and packed into a 5-cm diameter steel tube with a dynamic compaction effort of 2,700 kN-m/m<sup>3</sup> (equivalent to the ASTM modified Proctor compaction test, D1557-12e1 [-@ASTMD15572015]. The soil will be packed in a single lift to minimize heterogeneities in the specimen which could arise due to lack of binding between successive lifts. Preparing the specimens in a relatively soft condition also ensures minimal air entrapment. For each mixture, 6 replicate cylinders will be prepared. 

The specimens will be extruded with a manual hydraulic bottle jack (Figure \@ref(fig:proctor-extruder)). One specimen will be immediately sealed in an air-tight plastic bag. The rest will be slowly air dried under a loose polyethylene sheet. Each specimen will be dried to progressively lower water contents and sealed in a plastic bag until testing, with the final specimen being completely air-dried. The goal is to evaluate at least 3 water contents where ductile behavior is observed and at least 2 samples where brittle behavior is observed. This will allow the maximum toughness value to be bracketed by the tests.

```{r proctor-extruder, fig.cap='Bottle jack specimen extruder for preparing compression test specimens.', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/gilson_stock_proctor_extruder_photo.jpg')
```


The specimens will be subjected to unconfined compression tests at the Penn State Civil Infrastructure Testing and Evaluation Laboratory. Axial strain and nominal stress will be recorded up to 20% strain or an abrupt failure criterion. The water content of the specimen will then be determined.  

A smooth curve will be fitted to the stress-strain curve using general additive models in the R language for statistical computing [@baseR]. Toughness will be computed as the definite integral up to failure. An arbitrary failure criterion (i.e. maximum acceptable strain) will be chosen for the ductile specimens; this depends on the degree of acceptable deformation by the groundskeeper and has not yet been calculated. 

Toughness will be plotted against water content, and a second curve will be used to determine the rate of change in toughness per unit water content. It is anticipated that this relationsip will follow a semi-logarithmic shape, as for the Barnes apparatus [@Barnes2013]. Figure \@ref(fig:barnes-toughness-vs-water-content-example-plot) shows such a plot. 

Finally, the coefficients from the toughness-water content relationship for each sample can be analyzed as a function of sand content and clay type. This two-way ANOVA will permit the toughness slope to be computed for any soil based on its initial toughness. 

### Timeline 

These tests will be completed beginning in Fall 2021 and continue through April of 2022. 


## Dissertation chapter 3: Effect of oversize particles on Atterberg limits of artificial sand-clay mixtures

### Principal research questions

1. Can Atterberg limit tests be performed when sand particles up to 2 mm sieve diameter are included in a soil?
2. What is the effect of using coarser or finer sand?
3. What is the effect of sand uniformity?

### Hypotheses

1. The tests can be performed using identical methodology to ASTM D4318 with the 425 &mu; washing step eliminated

2. The liquid limit will be lower for coarser sand due to reduced surface area of the sand particles relative to finer sand.

3. Coarser sand will cause greater particle interference in the plastic limit thread as it nears its 3.2 mm diameter. The thread will crumble prematurely, raising the plastic limit value.

4. The combined effect of (2) and (3) will yield a smaller plasticity index for coarser sand. The results of the experiment can be used to apply a correction for the presence of oversize particles without their removal prior to testing. 

### Materials and Methods 

....


### Timeline 

The experiments were begun in March of 2020 during the initial COVID-19 stay-at-home order. Data collection is nearing completion. 


## Dissertation chapter 4: A critical appraisal of particle size analysis as a proxy for infield soil behavior

### Principal research questions 

1. Can particle size distribution (PSD) be accurately measured using a range of laboratory techniques?
2. Does the increased PSD resolution from laser diffraction provide useful information about an infield mix?
2. What particle size metrics are the best and worst predictors of infield performance?

### Hypotheses 

1. Specimen pre-treatment will drastically alter the results of a particle size test. This uncertainty is associated with the test protocol and is independent of operator performance. The hydrometer and pipette yield similar results, but the laser diffraction method requires an empirical correlation to permit comparison with older methods. The most important step is the physical disaggregation of the soil; ultrasonic dispersion will yield higher clay percentages than stirring or shaking methods. 
2. Laser diffraction allows rapid analyses of more size fractions than sedimentation analyses, and the amount of fine clay will correlate with infield performance. 
3. Even with the larger dataset produced with laser diffraction, considering the silt and clay fractions will correlate only loosely with infield performance as measured in  

### Materials and methods 

#### Experiment 1

5 soils will be tested using 3 pre-treatment protocols: 

1. ASTM D7928; milkshake mixer method [@ASTMD79282017]
2. ASTM D7928; overnight shaker method [@ASTMD79282017]
3. ASTM D7928; ultrasonic dispersion method [@ASTMD79282017]

These will each be sampled with the pipette method, considered the standard technique for mechanical analysis in soil science [@Gee2002].

Soils dispersed with method (3) will also be subjected to 4 additional sampling methods:

1. pipette analysis with samples removed at 20, 5, 2, and 0.2 &mu;m equivalent spherical diameters; sand tested with sieve method
2. hydrometer analysis with measurements taken for 20, 5, and 2 &mu;m equivalent spherical diameters; sand tested with sieve method
3. laser diffraction analysis for fine fraction and either: 
  a. sand fraction analyzed with sieve method
  b. sand fraction analyzed with dry laser diffraction method

```{r particle-size-experiments-sample-number-calculation}
n_soils <- 5
n_psa_reps <- 5
n_dispersion_treatments <- 3
n_sampling_methods <- 4

n_total_tests <- n_soils*n_dispersion_treatments*n_psa_reps + n_soils*n_sampling_methods*n_psa_reps

```


All tests will be replicated `r n_psa_reps` times to allow statistical comparison. 

The author has already developed software for the data management and analysis tasks involved for these experiments. The data can be batch-analyzed, reducing the time for data processing to virtually zero. 
In total, these experiments sum to `r n_total_tests` total analyses. 

### Timeline

These experiments will be conducted throughout 2021, primarily during the summer and early fall. Current lab capacity is to test 12 specimens per workday, so the experiments equate to `r round(n_total_tests/12, 0)` full days of testing. 


## Dissertation chapter 5: A rational basis for the design of soil mixtures used on baseball and softball infields


### Principal research questions 

1. How can better infield mixes be designed?
2. How can the performance of an existing mix be improved without replacing it?
3. What criteria best relate to infield performance, defined as the range of water contents where the soil is both plastic and stiff enough to support athletic maneuvers?

### Hypotheses 

1. Infield mix design should start with the toughness of an available clay soil, not the final sand %.
2. The level of play and maintenance budget will dictate the desired toughness level. 
3. The upper bound of the amount of clay soil component that should be included in the mix is a function of the dry shear strength of the mix because it is this property that governs the workability of the mix (i.e. the ability to groom it with implements and hand tools)
4. If a given toughness level is desired, the % sand needed to achieve this can be computed from empirical equations.
5. Ideally, toughness should be directly measured when designing a new mix; however it can also be estimated from an empirical correlation with the Atterberg limits 
6. Particle size analysis is acceptable for quality control purposes, but not for design. Only once a desired blend of a particular sand with a particular clay is established through toughness testing can a definite ratio of sand-size particles to fines be defined for that mix. 
7. Amending existing soils should be done on the basis of plastictity rather than silt-to-clay ratio. The resulting mixture's properties will not be a linear interpolation between the two; thus a calibration of Atterberg limit results may be required by making several mixtures (for example 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% of soil A with the implied amount of soil B) to determine the proper amendment ratio.


### Materials and Methods 

This paper is primarily a synthesis of the methods papers described above. It will combine the methods into a single framework for designing infield mixes. Simple metrics will be defined, and the framework will be tested by using materials which were _not_ tested in the other experiments to validate the theory's merit. 

### Timeline 

This is the final paper I will write as it encompasses all the lab work and other publications. I anticipate writing it in the second half of 2022.




The end game/envisaged process of mix design: 

1. Decide what toughness value you want - this is determined by the level of play and maintenance capability. 

2. Test the toughness of the pure "clay" (or estimate it from the empirical equation published by @Moreno-Maroto2018, or hopefully via an even better equation I will make with my compression test method for toughness)

3. Use an empirical equation I will develop to interpolate along the dose-respone curve of toughness vs. sand content. It will probably be linear for coarse sand and non-linear for finer sand. Probably I would need to develop multiple equations based on the properties of the sand....either choose from two or three equations (i.e. sand too fine, sand ok, sand excellent), or what would be even better (but probably beyond the scope of my own project and therefore a great starter for one of my future grad students) is to represent the sand variable as something continuous, such as mean particle diameter, or better yet specific surface area (could derive this from PSA curve with a correctly-fitted model) and then you would have _two_ continuous variables with which to form the dose-response curve. Anyway, you interpolate on this curve to get the sand-clay ratio you want, then make the mixture from that ratio. In this way the properties of the resultant mixture are not only replicable, they are precisely controllable. You have your hand on the dial!

Basically you end up with a line plotting toughness against % sand. The nature of the line is determined by :
1. the intercept of the line is determined by the initial toughness (i.e. that of the "pure" clay soil component) which is in turn determined by the mineralogy and particle size of the clay soil component. 
2. the slope is determined _both_ by the type of clay (i.e. the slope is a function of toughness; tougher clays will not be dilluted as easily; they will retain their toughness at higher sand contents; their slopes will be shallower) **and** the type of sand (i.e. the slope is a function of sand type, but only above ~20% sand)


Generally speaking, the larger the athletes the higher the toughness you want. The maximum toughness that can be used as an infield mix is governed by the strength of dry clods because they have to be draggable. This is complicated by the use of conditioner because they will increase the friability of the soil when used on a real infield. So you can use a base soil which has slightly higher toughness than would really be acceptable if there were no conditioner around....but how much higher is a hard question to answer. To find out you would have to do a conditioner titration on the soils which bracket this transition.
