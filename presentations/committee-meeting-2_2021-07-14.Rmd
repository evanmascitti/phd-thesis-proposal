# Acceptable boundaries 

- brittle & hard vs. soft & unstable 

- changing $w$ or $\theta$ due to weather

- same soil, from wet to dry

- across soils? 

- $\theta_{crit}$ ?


---
# PSA is king (for now)

---
# Method development 

- what didn't work

- what is working 

---
background-image: url('committee-meeting-2-presentation-dependencies/cleatmark-device-low-res.png')
background-size: contain

- add image of iPhone scan
---

- image of Drohan scanner samples 

- and finally our scanner 

- explain difficulty in obtaining fast and high-quality scans (lighting, angles, reflection)

- then the orientation and processing pipeline

all told, about a 90% reduction in time required to obtain a single measurement

background-image: url('committee-meeting-2-presentation-dependencies/daily-specimen-repairs-panels.png')
background-size: contain

- sample preparation routines (compaction protocols and repairs)



---

measuring the water content accurately; $w$ vs $\theta$

---


even with these improvements it is a full day; need several data points to define curve 

therefore must choose mixtures very carefully to represent as broad a spectrum of potential clays as possible 
---

- finally, some data

# Representative materials

- goal is to have a range of particle sizes, mineralogy, AND plasticity/toughness
- adjust SCR by adding pure Qz silt

collecting the data is a lot of work so choosing the right materials to test is VERY important
