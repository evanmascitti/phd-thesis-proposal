Portions of a baseball field are termed **skin** if they comprise bare soil rather than natural grass or synthetic turf. 
The pitcher's mound and the area immediately surrounding home plate are skinned areas, but these are considered distinct from the infield skin. 
<!-- because they are constructed and maintained somewhat differently. -->
The term "infield" sometimes refers to the infield grass portion of the field.
This thesis will not study the infield grass, nor will it treat the mound and home plate areas in detail.
Therefore, I use the terms "infield" and "infield skin" interchangeably. 

A full-size baseball field occupies about `r round(sum(pnc_areas$total_area_ha), 0)` ha (Figure \@ref(fig:player-locations)). Roughly `r DescTools::RoundTo(x = turf_area_pct, multiple = 5)`% of this total area is surfaced with natural turfgrass or synthetic turf. 
An additional `r DescTools::RoundTo(x = wt_area_pct, multiple = 5)`% is occupied by the warning track, which is alerts players that they are nearing the wall by its changing feel underfoot. 
Only about `r DescTools::RoundTo(x = skin_area_pct, multiple = 5)`% of the total playing surface is occupied by the infield skin.

<!-- I like the passage below, and I did spend a few hours finding the data/reference....but not sure it fits here. Thus I am saving it but commenting out. -->

<!-- It is in the defense's interest to encourage the offense to hit as many ground balls as possible, and this heightens the importance of the infield skin. In Major League Baseball (MLB), the average ground ball produces 0.04 runs while causing 0.80 outs. In contrast, the average ball hit in the air creates 0.23 runs and 0.62 outs. Therefore, on a runs-per-outs basis, a fly ball is nearly _8 times_ as valuable to the offense as a ground ball [@Carruth2010].  -->
To motivate the significance of the infield skin, consider Figures \@ref(fig:player-locations)-\@ref(fig:labor-per-area-fig).^[Data used to compute the values in Figure \@ref(fig:labor-per-area-fig) are compiled in the Appendix, see Table \@ref(tab:labor-per-area-tab)] 
All the offensive players, the four infielders, and the pitcher and catcher are standing on skinned areas (Figure \@ref(fig:player-locations)). 
A majority of important plays occur on skinned areas (Figure \@ref(fig:batted-ball-density)). The funds and effort devoted to maintaining them are disproportionately large (Figure \@ref(fig:labor-per-area-fig)).

Great effort is made by the grounds staff to sustain the infield in a playable condition. 
Wet playing conditions are the primary cause of postponements. 
A host MLB franchise may lose > $500,000 if a game is canceled because refunds must be offered to fans but stadium operation costs are fixed. 
Therefore, every attempt is made to keep the field in a playable condition and complete the game. 

At the youth level, most revenue is driven by concessions and tournament registration fees. 
Repeated postponements can undermine a facility's operating model. 
Continuing gameplay during and after rain events is critical for both professional and recreational operations.

Athlete safety is paramount to players' well-being and to the business success of a professional franchise. 
Figure \@ref(fig:mlb-salaries) shows the distribution of MLB player salaries for 2019. 
The median MLB player salary in 2019 was \$`r median_2019_salary_millions` million, with `r total_2019_million_dollar_players` players earning over $1 million and `r total_2019_10_million_dollar_players` players earning over \$10 million. 
Figure \@ref(fig:mlb-salaries) also shows MLB revenue growth since 1995. 
These revenues support hundreds of jobs at each stadium which depend on the athletes' health and performance. 
Players are a franchise's most valuable asset. A team cannot afford for them be injured by a poor playing surface.


## The brittle-ductile transition and the "corkboard effect" {#corkboard-effect-section}

Minimal surface disruption is a crucial element of infield quality. 
A smooth playing surface ensures the game's outcome is decided by the players' performance alone and not influenced by chance events such as an errant ball bounce. 

Grounds managers consider ideal infield performance as follows: an athlete's studded footwear readily penetrates the soil at footstrike. 
The soil provides adequate resistance as the athlete completes his or her maneuver. 
The cleats release from the surface without separating any soil solids from the zone surrounding them. 
No material adheres to the studs or sole of the shoe. 
Thus, surface deformation is limited to a small indentation matching the shape of the stud. 
This phenomenon is known as “cleat-in, cleat-out” or "the corkboard effect.“^[named for its similarity to the experience of removing a thumbtack from a bulletin board.] 
In contrast, a poor-quality infield is one on which larger clods of soil are readily chipped out of the surface or easily fragmented into powder. 

Figure \@ref(fig:corkboard-concept) depicts the the corkboard phenomenon and its importance to gameplay. 
Small, narrow cleat indentations are unlikely to deflect a ball from its initial path. Larger depressions excavated by player's cleats (or the soil clods themselves) are impediments which tend to produce an errant bounce. 

```{r corkboard-concept, eval=T, fig.cap="\\textbf{A.} The \"cleat-in, cleat-out\" effect ensures predictable ball response. \\textbf{B.} Cleat indentations and soil clods inhibit a smooth and predictable ball path.", fig.scap="\"Cleat-in, cleat-out\" effect"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/illustrations/cleatmarks/corkboard_concept.png')
```

A given infield soil moves between these states as its water content changes. 
This change in state is formally termed the brittle-ductile transition. The brittle-ductile transition is examined further in this proposal's literature review on plasticity tests (Section \@ref(plasticity-tests)), but a brief description is provided here to establish its important link to infield performance. 


Some amount of yield must occur for a player’s cleats to penetrate the soil surface. 
The mode of yield depends on the water content and the packing arrangement of the soil particles. Yield may be one of two types:

1. **brittle yield**: Microcracks propagate through the soil skeleton, eventually coalescing to fracture the soil mass into discrete fragments. These clods adjust their positions to accommodate the cleats and are usually ejected from the depression as the shoe releases. Crumbling or cracking of soil is controlled by the distribution of imperfections or “weakest links” in the soil matrix [@Dexter2004]. 
or
2. **ductile yield**: Soil particles are re-arranged to accommodate the cleat, but the soil mass behaves as a continuum. 
No material is sepratated from the surface. 
In general, ductile yield attenuates more energy than brittle fracture [@Kuipers1984]. 

A second important consequence of a ductile yield mode is that if a batted baseball _does_ contact a cleat indentation, the surface will deform a second time. Changes to the ball's trajectory will be minimal. 
This scenario is preferred to a more rigid collision in which the ball is re-directed, possibly leading to a misplay or injury (Figure \@ref(fig:corkboard-concept)B). 

Grounds managers have observed that some soils undergo the brittle-ductile transition rapidly, while other soils can withstand a longer drying period before the behavior change occurs. 
Therefore, it seems plausible that infield soils could be designed to maximize the range of water content over which the corkboard phenomenon will persist.

It is emphasized that no scientific investigations of the corkboard effect have been performed. 
It is a solely qualitative description of soil behavior, and at present no measurements exist for its study. 


## Use of artificial soil mixtures on baseball infields

Baseball was first played in the early 19th century, but the definitive origins of the game are likely lost to history [@Walker1994]. 
The earliest recorded attempt to alter the physical properties of an infield soil was by Harry Wright in 1875. 
Wright and his contemporaries incorporated various materials into their infield soils to enhance stability, firmness, or drainage of the playing surface.
Amendments included organic debris (straw, ashes) and and inorganic materials (sand, lime, cinders) [@Morris2007].

Deliberately imported infield soils were first used beginning in the 1970s, but these were usually blended by the groundskeeper at the stadium rather than being purchased in bulk from a soil supplier (P. Zwaska, personal communication, 2020).

Popularity of engineered infield mixes has grown markedly since 2005. Today the majority of professional stadia utilize an engineered soil for their infield skin [@Hagerty2018].

## Summary - problem description

The infield skin is a crucial component of baseball's competitive and business operations. 
An ideal infield surface exhibits a combination of plasticity and stiffness. 
The soil must readily deform around the cleats so that they are not rejected, but it must also provide enough resistance to prevent the athlete from losing traction. 
A professional grounds crew expends significant effort to produce such a surface by diligently managing soil water content.
The grounds manager cannot adjust the infield's water content once the game begins.
The soil's condition changes throughout the game; it may become wetter during a rain event or drier during hot, sunny conditions. 
An ideal infield soil exhibits moderate stiffness while maintaining its plasticity over a wide range of water contents.
Such a soil increases the odds of completing a game during a rain event, and it allows the groundskeeper a larger margin for error when hand-watering.
