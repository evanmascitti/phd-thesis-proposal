% everything abve works well

\renewcommand{\chaptername}{Section}


% A simple version to just change the chapter label and format 
% see the docs, it is a shortcut instead of specifying the 
% entire formatting command. But it seems to do what I want

% I figured this out on my own (i.e. no hyperlink - see Section 2.4, "quick reference"
% in the docs for titlesec, link is http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/titlesec/titlesec.pdf

% \usepackage{titlesec}
% \titlelabel{Section \thechapter \quad}

% a more complex example using the titlesec package from overleaf

% A more complex example from the  titles package
% I changed the font size to Huge instead of Large but it doesn't seem to change 
% much. But I have to leave this alone for now and get back to something more 
% pressing 

% \usepackage{titlesec}
% 
% \titleformat
% {\chapter} % command
% [display] % shape
% {\bfseries\Huge\itshape} % format
% {Section \ \thechapter} % label
% {0.5ex} % sep

% re-style block quotations??
% there are 2 environments that handle block quotations- the quotation environment 
% is for multi-paragraph quotes and each paragraph is indented.
% the quote environment is meant for shorter quotes. Evidently R Markdown 
% puts at least the short ones in the quote environment; I discovered this by 
% inspecting the .tex file usingkeep_tex: true in the YAML


% see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4018493/vertical-line-with-every-quotation/4023967
% for solution
\usepackage{framed}

% change bar size to 0.5 pt instead of the default 3 pt

\renewenvironment{leftbar}{\def\FrameCommand{\vrule width 1pt \hspace{10pt}}\MakeFramed {\advance\hsize-\width \FrameRestore}}{\endMakeFramed}

% for multi-paragraph quotations 
% \renewenvironment{quotation}%
% {\begin{leftbar}\begin{quotation}}%
% {\end{quotation}\end{leftbar}}

% for single-paragraph quotations 
% remove indent with \noindent

\renewenvironment{quote}%
{\begin{leftbar}\small\begin{quotation}\noindent}%
{\end{quotation}\end{leftbar}}
