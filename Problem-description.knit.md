## Key ideas 

- The infield skin plays a vital role in gameplay. 
- Safety risks and revenue losses occur if the infield becomes unplayable due to rain.
- Infield quality is compromised when the soil becomes brittle and hard.
- Maintaining the infield soil's water content is a challenging task for grounds managers.
- A quality infield soil makes the field safer and the grounds manager's job easier.
- Infield mixes were developed through trial and error and may be refined through scientific study.

## Importance of the infield {#importance-of-the-infield} 








Portions of a baseball field are termed **skin** if they comprise bare soil rather than natural grass or synthetic turf. 
The pitcher's mound and the area immediately surrounding home plate are skinned areas, but these are considered distinct from the infield skin. 
<!-- because they are constructed and maintained somewhat differently. -->
The term "infield" sometimes refers to the infield grass portion of the field.
This thesis will not study the infield grass, nor will it treat the mound and home plate areas in detail.
Therefore, I use the terms "infield" and "infield skin" interchangeably. 

A full-size baseball field occupies about 1 ha (Figure \@ref(fig:player-locations)). Roughly 75% of this total area is surfaced with natural turfgrass or synthetic turf. 
An additional 15% is occupied by the warning track, which alerts players that they are nearing the wall by its changing feel underfoot. 
Only about 10% of the total playing surface is occupied by the infield skin.

<!-- I like the passage below, and I did spend a few hours finding the data/reference....but not sure it fits here. Thus I am saving it but commenting out. -->

<!-- It is in the defense's interest to encourage the offense to hit as many ground balls as possible, and this heightens the importance of the infield skin. In Major League Baseball (MLB), the average ground ball produces 0.04 runs while causing 0.80 outs. In contrast, the average ball hit in the air creates 0.23 runs and 0.62 outs. Therefore, on a runs-per-outs basis, a fly ball is nearly _8 times_ as valuable to the offense as a ground ball [@Carruth2010].  -->
To motivate the significance of the infield skin, consider Figures \@ref(fig:player-locations)-\@ref(fig:labor-per-area-fig).^[Data used to compute the values in Figure \@ref(fig:labor-per-area-fig) are compiled in the Appendix, see Table \@ref(tab:labor-per-area-tab)] 
All the offensive players, the four infielders, and the pitcher and catcher are standing on skinned areas (Figure \@ref(fig:player-locations)). 
A majority of important plays occur on skinned areas (Figure \@ref(fig:batted-ball-density)). The funds and effort devoted to maintaining them are disproportionately large (Figure \@ref(fig:labor-per-area-fig)).
