Existing research on this topic is relatively scant. This section describes the few published research studies and outlines the general goals of a baseball grounds manager. 5.1.1 Qualitative description of the importance of the infield Portions of a baseball field are termed skin if they comprise bare soil rather than natural grass or synthetic turf. The pitchers mound and the area immediately surrounding home plate are considered distinct; these are constructed and maintained somewhat differently from the infield skin. However, this thesis will not treat the mound or home plate areas in detail, so in this document the terms skin and infield skin are used interchangeably. A full-size baseball field occupies ~ 1 ha. Roughly 75% of this total area is surfaced with natural turfgrass or synthetic turf. An additional ~ 15% is occupied by the warning track, which is alerts players that they are nearing the wall by its changing feel underfoot. Only about 10% of the total playing surface is occupied by the infield skin. To motivate the significance of the infield skin, consider Figures 5.1-5.3.1 All the offensive players, the four infielders, and the pitcher and catcher are standing on skinned areas. A large majority of important plays occur here, so the funds and effort devoted to maintaining this area are disproportionately large. Figure 5.1: Locations of players during a professional baseball game. Note the paucity of players on turf (blue arrows) compared to bare soil/skin areas (red arrows). Figure 5.2: Data from actual MLB contests support the intuition that most play occurs on the infield skin. Figure 5.3: The infield skin consumes a majority of inputs despite comprising less than 10 percent of the playing surface area. At the professional level, great efforts are made to sustain the infield in a playable condition. If a game is cancelled due to field conditions, the host franchise stands to lose several hundred thousand dollars. Therefore, every attempt is made to keep the field in a playable condition and complete the game. At the youth level, most revenue is also driven by concessions and repeated cancellations of tournaments or games may undermine the sustinability of the organizations finances. Many facilities generate a large portion of annual revenue over only a handful of concentrated events (for example, a 3-day tournament). The median MLB player salary in 2019 was x , with x players earning over $20 million. In a very real sense, elite athletes bodies are the most valued asset of an MLB franchise. Every effort must be made to ensure that player injuries are prevented so a teams investment is not squandered due to lost playing time. A safe infield surface is a must. Toughness is an important property of an infield soil. When the soil offers adequate resistance to foot traffic, play may continue during rain. Once the resistance is lowered enough to make footing unsafe, the game is halted, and the grounds crew covers the field with an impermeable tarp to prevent further saturation. Rain delays and postponements lead to lost revenue and create schedule conflicts at both the professional and recreational levels. Moreover, deployment of the tarp during rainfall is dangerous and physically difficult. Even when weather conditions are favorable, high toughness allows the groundskeeper a wider range of water contents to provide excellent playability. This minimizes mistakes when hand-watering the infield. The groundskeeper is unable to add water to the infield once the game has begun. In hot and dry weather., the soil dries and becomes excessively hard as the game progresses, affecting ball response and also inducing brittle bulking from cleat (Ch. __). Therefore soil toughness also allows the soil to retain its plastic behavior as soil moisture is reduced. The main surface properties of interest to the athlete (and therefore to the grounds manager) are footing and ball response. Each can be further subdivided. 5.1.1.1 Footing 5.1.1.1.1 Traction Traction allows the athlete to run, change directions, and perform other maneuvers without slipping, sliding, or otherwise losing control. Traction is distinct from planar friction because of the presence of studs or other gripping aids on the players footwear (McNitt et al., 1997). Even when using machine tests (rather than human subjects), measuring traction is complicated by nonlinear interactions between surface type, shoe type, and loading weights (Nigg, 1990). Excessive rotational traction is associated with lower extremity injuries, but traction differences among shoe types are often larger than those across surface types (Serensits and McNitt, 2014). Clear-cut thresholds separating acceptable and unaccpetable traction have not been established. Most athletic field research has focused on natural grass and synthetic turf. There are two published accounts of traction measurements on infield skin surfaces. Goodall et al. (2005) measured traction on plots constructed from 5 different soils blended with 4 rates of calcined clay. Higher traction levels were reported for silty and loamy soils than for sandier soils. Mixing the soil with calcined clay prior to plot construction had no effect on traction. No relationship was found between traction and water content, although only 3 water contents were tested. Brosnan et al. (2011) measured traction on research plots of the same infield soil subjected to various treatments. Traction was increased by soil compaction and decreased by surficial additions of calcined clay. 5.1.1.1.2 The brittle-ductile transition and the corkboard effect Minimal surface disruption is a crucial element of infield quality. A smooth playing surface ensures the games outcome is decided by the players performance alone and not influenced by chance events such as an errant ball bounce. Grounds managers consider ideal infield performance as follows: an athletes studded footwear readily penetrates the soil at footstrike. The soil provides adequate resistance as the athlete completes his or her maneuver. The cleats release from the surface without separating any soil solids from the zone surrounding them. No material adheres to the studs or sole of the shoe. Thus, surface deformation is limited to a small indentation matching the shape of the stud. This phenomenon is known as cleat-in, cleat-out or \"the corkboard effect2. In contrast, a poor-quality infield is one on which larger clods of soil are readily chipped out of the surface or easily fragmented into powder. Figure 5.4 depicts the importance of the corkboard phenomenon. Small, narrow cleat indentations are unlikely to deflect a ball from its initial path, while larger depressions excavated by players cleats (or the soil clods themselves) are impediments which tend to produce an errant bounce. Figure 5.4: (A) The cleat-in, cleat-out effect ensures predictable ball response. (B) Cleat indentations and soil clods inhibit a smooth and predictable ball path. A given infield soil moves between these states as its water content changes. This change in state is formally termed the brittle-ductile transition. The brittle-ductile transition is examined further in the 5.2 section, but a brief description is provided below to establish its important link to infield performance. A skilled grounds crew takes great care to maintain the soil at the desired moisture. Water is manually added with hoses, and rain is kept off using a large tarpaulin. Soil water content can only be controlled during field preparation; after the game begins, no further adjustments can be made and weather conditions determine the rate of water loss or gain. Grounds managers have observed that some soils undergo the brittle-ductile transition rapidly, while other soils can withstand a longer drying period before the behavior change occurs. Therefore, it seems plausible that infield soils could be designed to maximize the range of water content over which the corkboard phenomenon will persist. Some amount of yield must occur for a players cleats to penetrate the soil surface. The mode of yield depends on the water content and the packing arrangement of the soil particles. Yield may be one of two types: brittle yield: microcracks propagate through the soil skeleton, eventually coalescing to fracture the soil mass into discrete fragments. These clods adjust their positions to accommodate the cleats and are usually ejected from the depression as the shoe releases. Crumbling or cracking of soil is controlled by the distribution of imperfections or weakest links in the soil matrix (Dexter, 2004). In general, brittle deformation attenuates less energy than ductile deformation (Kuipers, 1984). or ductile yield: soil particles are re-arranged to accommodate the cleat, but the soil mass behaves as a continuum. The remolded zone around the indentation is likely to be small and more uniform with space (Deepa et al., 2013). Ductile behavior is usually associated with higher mechanical strain and more generation of heat (Perez, 2017). A second important consequence of a ductile yield mode is that if a batted baseball does contact a cleat indentation, the surface will deform a second time. Changes to the balls trajectory will be minimal. This scenario is preferred to a more rigid collision in which the ball is re-directed, possibly leading to a misplay or injury (Figure 5.4). It is emphasized that no scientific investigations of the corkboard effect have been performed. It is a solely qualitative description of soil behavior, and at present no metrics exist for its study. 5.1.2 Ball response The reaction of a baseball upon contact with the surface plays a key role in the outcome of competition (recall Figures 5.3-5.2). As for footing, limited research is available on infield ball response. Goodall et al. (2005) is the only published account of controlled research on multiple infield soils. The authors installed 5 soils which were commercially available within the northeastern United States. Static and dynamic ball friction were measured along with traction and other soil properties. The authors found that increases in water content raised the coefficients of static and dynamic friction between the ball and the soil surface. The increase was likely due to greater ball penetration, increasing the contact area between the ball and the surface and also prolonging their interaction. Goodall et al. (2005) suggested that surface pace may be more related to friction than to hardness. This agrees with intuition because the main component of a ground balls velocity is horizontal (nearly coplanar with the surface), favoring the importance of horizontal friction rather than vertical rebound. Incorporation of calcined clay (particle size 0.5 - 2 mm) also decreased friction, especially for finer-textured soils. Brosnan et al. studied the effects of construction and maintenance activities on infield surface pace (2011). Higher bulk density (bulk) increased surface pace, although the range of bulk densities tested (1.2-1.8 Mg m-3) was beneath values typically encountered on infield skins (authors personal observation; data not shown). Water content was negatively correlated with surface pace, but no attempt was made to intentionally alter water content among plots. This study was performed on a single soil material. The effect of ball spin may be large or small depending on the playing surface properties. If the ball-surface friction coefficient is high, the ball will roll through impact and its release angle will be altered (Figure 5.5). The new spin rate will be determined by the incoming velocity and the friction coefficient. Sidespin imparted by the bowler will readily grip the surface and alter its horizontal path (Daish, 1972). Alternatively, when friction is low, the ball will skid through impact and retain some of its original spin. Figure 5.5: Initial spin will influence a balls release angle following impact. Adapted from Daish, 1972. When soil stiffness is low, the ball produces a notable deformation of the pitch. This prolongs the duration of the impact and gives friction more time to operate. As the ball releases, it rolls up the saucer-like depression created by the impact. This yields a slightly steeper release angle relative to that of a more rigid soil surface (Figure 5.6). Figure 5.6: A. A rigid soil surface produces a lower release angle, provided no imperfections are present in the surface. B. A surface with lower stiffness encourages the ball to roll out of the shallow depression created by impact, leading to a slightly steeper release angle. Infield soil bear some similarity to cricket pitches and these have been researched more extensively. Ball response is influenced by soil bulk density, clay content, water content, organic matter, and particle size distribution (Baker, 2006). A laboratory study on surface friction of cricket soils was made by Adams and Young (2001). This experiment mixed the same clayey soil with 6 types of coarse amendments. All final mixes had sand contents between 30 and 40% by mass. Ball-to-surface friction was highest for the mix containing sand between 125-60 m. Lower friction was measured for soils with coarser or finer amendments. Using a suede-type leather increased friction relative to polished leather, implying that the degree of wear on the ball may influence surface pace. 5.1.3 Summary of the infield skins value The infield skin is a crucial component of baseballs competitive and business operations. A professional grounds crew expends significant effort to maintain the soil water content within this relatively narrow range. An ideal infield surface exhibits a combination of plasticity and stiffness. The soil must readily deform around the cleats so that they are not rejected, but it must also provide enough resistance to prevent the athlete from sliding. 5.1.4 Use of artificial soil mixtures on baseball infields Baseball was first played in the early 19th century, but the definitive origins of the game are likely lost to history (Walker et al., 1994). The earliest recorded attempt to alter the physical properties of an infield soil was by Harry Wright in 1875. Wright and his contemporaries incorporated various materials into their infield soils to enhance stability, firmness, or drainage of the playing surface. Amendments included organic debris (straw, ashes) and and inorganic materials (sand, lime, cinders) (Morris, 2007). Infield soil mixes were produced off-site and imported beginning in the 1960s ?Zwasksa?. Popularity of engineered infield mixes has grown markedly since 2005 and today the majority of professional stadia utilize an engineered soil for their infield skin. 5.2 Laboratory tests of soil behavior and physical properties Ideally, researchers and practitioners could measure all soil properties of interest on an unlimited number of samples. In practice, this is prevented by time constraints and cost. Simpler tests are commonly used as surrogate markers to model the soils actual properties in the field. The methodology of these tests has been subjected to considerable study because much is riding on their precision and accuracy. This section summarizes the development and evaluation of laboratory test methods pertinent to infield soils. 5.2.1 Compaction tests 5.2.2 Compression and shear strength tests 5.2.3 Atterberg limits 5.2.3.1 Origins of the test methods The terms ductile and plastic3 are used synonymously. A common definition of plasticity is the tendency of a material to deform under an applied load, without fracturing into multiple pieces, and to retain its new shape when the load is removed (Andrade et al., 2011). The earliest test methods for soil plasticity were developed by Atterberg (1911), (1974). Atterberg noted that although plasticity is easy to observe, the phenomenon does not lend itself to simple measurement. He showed that the consistency of the soil was determined by its water content, and he reasoned that soil was plastic only within a finite range of water content, which differed for every soil. The upper water content boundary was defined as the flow limit, at which two batches of soil paste flowed together when jarred, and the lower water content boundary was defined as the rolling limit, at which the soil could no longer be rolled into thin threads. Atterberg called the difference between these two characteristic water contents the plasticity number (now known as the plasticity index or PI). He defined five other thresholds of soil behavior, though the others are not commonly used today. Atterberg deemed the plasticity number as the most reliable means of measuring plasticity, though upon reading his work one senses a reluctance to accept this simple number as a fully adequate measure of this complex phenomenon. He pointed out that his plasticity number provides no information amount of plastic strain incurred during deformation, nor does it enumerate the stress required to impart the deformation. He considered the effort needed to deform the soil a separate property, which translates to English as viscosity; this property was later termed toughness by Casagrande (1932). The value of Atterbergs work has never been fully realized in his own discipline of soil science. However, the utilty of his test methods was clear to those in the then-novel field of geotechnical engineering. Terzaghi (1926) and Casagrande (1932) modified and standardized the Atterberg limit tests, leading to their widespread adoption for the design and control of earthworks projects. Terzaghi (1926) acknowledged the arbitrary nature of the tests, yet emphasized their value as a preliminary soil classification tool. He scorned qualitative definitions of soils and favored the use of quantitative descriptions: Every engineer should develop the habit of expressing the plasticity and grain-size characteristics of soils by numerical values rather than adjectives..the degree of plasticity should be indicated by the estimated value of the plasticity index and not by the words trace of plasticity or highly plastic. Terzaghi et al. (1996) 5.2.3.2 Liquid limit test: mechanics and sources of error The liquid limit test described by Atterberg (1911) included an unacceptable degree of operator dependence because it required the operator to manually agitate the soil. A mechanical test method was first presented by Casagrande (1932). The Casagrande method uses a brass cup fixed to a rotating cam, which agitates the soil paste by dropping the cup against a hard rubber base of specified height. The method has undergone little alteration up to the present. The Casagrande apparatus must be frequently calibrated to ensure accurate results. The most likely sources of error are a worn grooving tool and variability in in drop height caused by a loose locking screw. However, provided a standard test device is used, differences in operator technique comprise a larger source of error than the device itself (Sherwood, 1970). A recent survey by Haigh (2016) supports Casagrandes warning that the stiffness of the rubber base can significantly affect the test result. An alternative test device for liquid limit determination was adopted by BS ______ (reference from Holtz et al. ?? ) 5.2.3.3 Plastic limit test: mechanics and sources of error Current protocols for the plastic limit include ASTM D4318, AASHTO T 90, and B.S. 1377. In the test, a soil is first wetted to the liquid limit to encourage full saturation. After performing the liquid limit test, a ~10 g sample of soil is gradually dried by gentle blow drying and re-molding. Once the soil can be molded without sticking to the operators skin, the soil is rolled into a thread of 3 mm diameter, broken apart, and pressed into a new lump. This process is repeated until the soil crumbles when the rolling action is applied. Terzaghi (1926) introduced the use of a fixed thread diameter. Recently, the significance of the thread diameter has been questioned (Barnes, 2013). The stability of the soil thread is related to the maximum particle diameter and the rolling technique, and Barnes (2013) argued that emphasis should be shifted away from a specific thread diameter and toward observation of the thread during the test. 5.2.3.4 Attempts to improve Atterberg limit methods Most attempts to improve the plastic limit test have focused on mechanizing the thread-rolling procedure in hopes of improving its reproducibility across operators. . Test operators utilize different combinations of force, speed, and displacement when rolling the soil. Collectively these variables were termed rolling path by (Barnes, 2013). Bobrowski and Griekspoor (1992) described a simple apparatus to aid the operator in producing a thread of precisely 3.2 mm. The device consists of a flat plexiglass plate which is used to roll the thread, rather than the operators hand. (Bobrowski and Griekspoor, 1992) also state that paper should be affixed to the base of the device to prevent the thread from sliding and to expedite the drying process. Use of this device is allowed, but not mandated, in the current version of ASTM D4318. This device has been criticized by (Barnes, 2013), who cited the data of (Rashid et al., 2008) to assert the rolling device produces excessively rapid drying and eliminates the soil thread from the view of the operator. A fully mechanized thread rolling apparatus was developed by (Temyingyong et al., 2002). Their device used two acrylic plates similar to (Bobrowski and Griekspoor, 1992) and added a DC motor to apply the rolling action. The DC voltage was adjusted to control the rolling speed, and the downward force was altered by the addition of weights to the upper plate. They found that the initial diameter of the soil mass explained a larger amount of variation in the test result than did factors which might be ascribed to the subjective manual method (speed and pressure). The device still appears to be a significant improvement over the hand-rolling method; unfortunately, the device is not commercially available and its use has not been adopted by governing bodies. Barnes (2009) introduced a novel thread-rolling apparatus which allows precise control of the load applied to the soil thread. The device comprises two stainless steel plates: a fixed base and an upper loading plate which is manually oscillated. The load is adjusted by sliding a weight ballast along the side of the device opposite the handle. The further the ballast weight is from a pivot point, the lesser the load on the soil thread. The device is still operated by hand and a constant rate of rolling must be maintained through careful operation. A thin smear of petrolatum is used on the stainless steel plates to encourage extrusion of the soil thread. A number of other useful properties have been developed with this device, as described in the section of this review on soil toughness. Moreno-Marato and Alonso-Azcàrate described a plastic limit test in a soil thread is bent rather than rolled. The soil is wetted to a moldable consistency and flattened to ~3 mm. A special slicing tool is used to create a rectangular prism of soil having precise dimensions of 3 mm x 3mm x 50 mm. The specimen is then rounded into a cylindrical thread using the same tool. The thread is carefully bent about its center, which is anchored around a stainless steel cylinder. When the thread begins to crack, a caliper is used to measure the distance between the two ends of the thread. The test is repeated for at least two other water contents and the water content of the threads is plotted against the displacement with segmented regression. The shallower segment is extrapolated to zero displacement and this water content is taken as the plastic limit. Moreno-Marato and Alonso-Azcàrate also described a faster version of their original thread-bending test. In this version only a single thread is prepared and its displacement and water content are extrapolated to zero displacement using an empirical equation. This test meets the original requirements of any plastic limit test which could replace the current method, namely: Rapid repeatable Operator-independent Many soil tests have been developed with the goal of supplanting the Atterberg limits. However, in the authors view, these tests are unlikely to be abandoned because of the abundance of data which has accumulated from their use and the speed with which they can be performed. 5.2.4 Toughness tests Toughness is the energy dissipated during a loading event. It is mathematically defined as the area beneath a stress-strain curve up to failure. Toughness bears units of energy per volume (i.e. work; SI units \\(\\mathrm{frac{J}{m^3}}\\)) (Mamlouk and Zaniewski., 2006). In other words, toughness is the total effort required to deform a specimen to its failure condition. The integral is traditionally computed over the entire material test, but the strain range may be abitrarily defined for a specific problem (e.g. Barnes (2013)). A large peak strength does not necessarily imply a material is tough. A brittle material may have a high strength, but because it fails at low strain the toughness is relatively low. Conversely, a ductile material which deforms to very high strain levels may be quite tough despite its low ultimate strength (Mamlouk and Zaniewski., 2006). Many fine-textured soils exhibit ductile behavior, but their strength in this state varies widely. This fact is implicit to all who work intimately with clay in trades such as pottery production or earthworks. Casagrande (1932) noted in his landmark Atterberg limits paper: &gt;There is a wide variation in the shearing resistance of different soils at the plastic limit. This difference may be felt by hand when performing the plastic limit test on various soils.the toughness of a clay at its plastic limit may therefore be described as the maximum stiffness or shearing resistance which it can acquire without losing its plasticity. The plastic limit therefore reflects only the water content at which a drying soil becomes brittle, and on its own should not be considered a measure of soil strength or toughness. This distinction has been blurred in academic literature, where the plastic limit is sometimes reported as the water content corresponding to a particular value of cone penetration (e.g. Whyte (1982)). Reported values of peak strength at the plastic limit differ by up to 2 orders of magnitude (Haigh et al., 2013). 5.2.5 Particle size analysis At the time of writing, particle size analysis is the only means of soil testing which has been applied to infield soils. Mechanical analysis is relatively rapid and inexpensive, and it has been used as a surrogate marker for nearly every aspect of soil science. A tremendous amount of data has accumulated with particle size analysis as its basis. It is useful to examine the principles which underlie the analysis and the development of the techniques, and to identify potential sources of error during the tests. Brosnan and McNitt (2008) surveyed the surface conditions of the infield skin on extant playing fields at three maintenance levels. Particle size analyses were performed on soil sampled from each infield skin. The USDA soil texture of those samples is plotted in 5.7. These soils were sampled from the upper 13 mm and contained large granules of calcined clay infield conditioner; therefore, the texture measured with this method is coarser than the true texture of the base soil. Figure 5.7: Infield soils suyveyed by Brosnan (2008a) 5.3 Design and properties of artificial soil mixtures Natural soil materials are excavated and deliberately blended for many uses. Potting mixes and green roof media are the largest means of production by volume (reference ??). The purpose of blending multiple soil materials is to create a product having properties not exhibited by any naturally occurring soil material. Even if the desired properties could be found in a single naturally occurring material, the properties of natural soils are subject to spatial variation. In such a scenario, the properties of the mixture can be held constant simply by adjusting the ratio of the components. The Atterberg limits and unconfined compression testing are the primary means which have been used to charazcterize soil mixtures. These mixtures may contain two components(sand and clay), or three components (sand and two separate types of clay soil) References "],["proposed-experiments.html", "6 Proposed experiments and papers 6.1 Chapter 1: A novel method for measuring surface deformation of baseball and softball infield skin soils 6.2 Chapter 2: Toughness of clay soil near the plastic limit using unconfined compression tests 6.3 Chapter 3: A critical appraisal of particle size analysis as a proxy for soil behavior 6.4 Chapter 4: A rational theory of mix design for blended soils used on baseball and softball infields", " 6 Proposed experiments and papers This section details the planned research, much of which has already begun. Figure {#gantt-chart} outlines envisaged timelines for these experiments. Many of the tests will be performed on the same soil mixtures and the experiments, while separate, have substantial overlap. Therefore the testing program will be structured to minimize bottlenecks. In other words, multiple experiments will be in progress at a given time because some of the protocols involve wait times (i.e. for several hours or overnight) during which other lab tasks can be performed. 6.1 Chapter 1: A novel method for measuring surface deformation of baseball and softball infield skin soils A new method to measure disturbance of baseball infield soils by cleated footwear 6.1.1 Principal research questions Can differences among infield mixes be observed in a laboratory test without using human subjects? How can performance be quantified? How can the method be made objective and repeatable? 6.1.2 Hypotheses The cleat-in, cleat-out phenomenon (described in Section @ref(#corkboard-effect)) can be duplicated using a machine and a laboratory-sized soil specimen. The means by which the soil specimen is prepared will affect the test result. Therefore, a protocol must be developed which adequately emulates the real procedures used for construction and maintenance of infield skins. Furthermore, the method must simulate outdoor conditions to adjust the soil water content. Subjectivity can be minimized by relying on 3D scanning technology to measure the response of the soil. Morphpometrics may be classified by means of the property they depend on; each metric will be minimized at similar water content but their sensitivity (i.e. relative magnitudes) will differ in this order: surface-area &gt; volume &gt; curvature. 6.1.3 Materials and Methods A mechanical apparatus has been developed to emulate a baseball or softball athletes foot-to-surface interaction (Figure 6.1). The device was designed and fabricated between May 2019 and March 2020 with service from the Penn State Engineering Services Shop. Figure 6.1: Left: The pneumatic apparatus used to simulate foot-to-surface interaction. Right: A typical 9-spike baseball cleat pattern. The apparatus comprises a pneumatic cylinder which combines high travel speed and precise control of the peak load. 6.1.4 Timeline The device was designed and fabricated between May 2019 and March 2020. Calibration and tuning of the machine is ongoing. The first set of mixtures is scheduled to be tested in Nov 2020. The goal is to complete all tests with this device by the end of 2021. 6.2 Chapter 2: Toughness of clay soil near the plastic limit using unconfined compression tests 6.3 Chapter 3: A critical appraisal of particle size analysis as a proxy for soil behavior 6.4 Chapter 4: A rational theory of mix design for blended soils used on baseball and softball infields The end game/envisaged process of mix design: Decide what toughness value you want - this is determined by the level of play and maintenance capability. Test the toughness of the pure clay (or estimate it from the empirical equation published by Moreno-Maroto and Alonso-Azcárate (2018), or hopefully via an even better equation I will make with my compression test method for toughness) Use an empirical equation I will develop to interpolate along the dose-respone curve of toughness vs. sand content. It will probably be linear for coarse sand and non-linear for finer sand. Probably I would need to develop multiple equations based on the properties of the sand.either choose from two or three equations (i.e. sand too fine, sand ok, sand excellent), or what would be even better (but probably beyond the scope of my own project and therefore a great starter for one of my future grad students) is to represent the sand variable as something continuous, such as mean particle diameter, or better yet specific surface area (could derive this from PSA curve with a correctly-fitted model) and then you would have two continuous variables with which to form the dose-response curve. Anyway, you interpolate on this curve to get the sand-clay ratio you want, then make the mixture from that ratio. In this way the properties of the resultant mixture are not only replicable, they are precisely controllable. You have your hand on the dial! Basically you end up with a line plotting toughness against % sand. The nature of the line is determined by : 1. the intercept of the line is determined by the initial toughness (i.e. that of the pure clay soil component) which is in turn determined by the mineralogy and particle size of the clay soil component. 2. the slope is determined both by the type of clay (i.e. the slope is a function of toughness; tougher clays will not be dilluted as easily; they will retain their toughness at higher sand contents; their slopes will be shallower) and the type of sand (i.e. the slope is a function of sand type, but only above ~20% sand) Generally speaking, the larger the athletes the higher the toughness you want. The maximum toughness that can be used as an infield mix is governed by the strength of dry clods because they have to be draggable. This is complicated by the use of conditioner because they will increase the friability of the soil when used on a real infield. So you can use a base soil which has slightly higher toughness than would really be acceptable if there were no conditioner around.but how much higher is a hard question to answer. To find out you would have to do a conditioner titration on the soils which bracket this transition.
