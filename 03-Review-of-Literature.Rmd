## Function and performance of baseball infields {#infield-performance} 

In baseball and softball, athletes engage with the playing surface in two ways: directly (by running, pivoting, and sliding) and indirectly (by fielding batted balls).

Forces are applied to the surface by athletes and by the ball. This section outlines the goals of a baseball grounds manager and the (relatively scant) prior scientific research on this topic.

Portions of a baseball field are termed **skin** if they comprise bare soil rather than natural or synthetic turf. Technically, the pitcher's mound and the area immediately surrounding home plate are considered distinct from the infield skin. However, this thesis will not treat the mound or home plate areas in detail, so in this document the terms "skin" and "infield skin" are used interchangeably. 

A full-size baseball field occupies ~ `r round(sum(pnc_areas$total_area_ha), 0)` ha. Roughly `r DescTools::RoundTo(x = turf_area_pct, multiple = 5)`% of this total area is surfaced with natural turfgrass or synthetic turf. An additional ~ `r DescTools::RoundTo(x = wt_area_pct, multiple = 5)`% is occupied by the warning track, which is designed to alert players that they are nearing the wall. Only about `r DescTools::RoundTo(x = skin_area_pct, multiple = 5)`% of the total playing surface is occupied by the infield skin.

<!-- I like the passage below, and I did spend a few hours finding the data/reference....but not sure it fits here. Thus I am saving it but commenting out. -->

<!-- It is in the defense's interest to encourage the offense to hit as many ground balls as possible, and this heightens the importance of the infield skin. In Major League Baseball (MLB), the average ground ball produces 0.04 runs while causing 0.80 outs. In contrast, the average ball hit in the air creates 0.23 runs and 0.62 outs. Therefore, on a runs-per-outs basis, a fly ball is nearly _8 times_ as valuable to the offense as a ground ball [@Carruth2010].  -->

To motivate the importance of the infield skin, consider Figures \@ref(fig:batted-ball-density)-(Figure (\@ref(fig:labor-per-area))^[Data used to compute these values is compiled in the Appendix, see Table \@ref(tab:labor-per-area-tab)]. All the offensive players, the four infielders, and the pitcher and catcher are standing on skinned areas. Because a large majority of important plays occur on the skin, the funds and effort devoted to maintaining the infield skin are disproportionately large.

The main properties of interest to the athlete (and therefore to the grounds manager) are footing and ball response. Each can be further subdivided. 

#### Footing 

##### Traction

Traction allows the athlete to run, change directions, and perform other maneuvers without slipping, sliding, or losing their balance. Traction is distinct from planar friction because of the presence of studs or other gripping aids on the players' footwear @McNitt1997a. Even when using machine tests (rather than human subjects), measuring traction is complicated by nonlinear interactions between surface type, shoe type, and loading weights [@Nigg1990]. Excessive traction is associated with lower extremity injuries, but traction differences among shoe types are often larger than those across surface types [@Serensits2014]. Clear-cut thresholds of acceptable and unaccpetable traction have not been established.

Most athletic field research has focused on natural grass and synthetic turf. There are two published accounts of traction measurements on infield skin surfaces. @Brosnan2011 measured traction on research plots of the same infield soil subjected to various treatments. Traction was increased by soil compaction and decreased by surficial additions of calcined clay. 

@Goodall2005 measured traction on plots constructed from 5 different soils blended with 4 rates of calcined clay. Higher traction levels were reported for silty and loamy soils than for sandier soils. Mixing the soil with calcined clay prior to plot construction had no effect on traction. No relationship was found between traction and water content, although only 3 water contents were tested.

##### The corkboard effect

Minimal surface disruption is a crucial element of infield quality. A smooth playing surface ensures the game's outcome is decided by the players' performance alone and is not influenced by chance events such as an errant ball bounce. 

Grounds managers consider ideal infield performance as follows: an athlete's studded footwear readily penetrates the soil at footstrike. As the athlete completes his or her maneuver, the cleats release without separating any soil solids from the zone surrounding the cleat. No material adheres to the studs or sole of the shoe. Thus, surface deformation is limited to a small indentation matching the shape of the stud. This phenomenon is known as “cleat-in, cleat-out” or "the corkboard effect.“^[named for its similarity to the experience of removing a thumbtack from a bulletin board.] In contrast, a poor-quality infield is one on which larger clods of soil are readily chipped out of the surface or easily fragmented into powder. 

Figure \@ref(fig:corkboard-concept) depicts the importance of the corkboard phenomenon. Small, narrow cleat indentations are unlikely to deflect a ball from its initial path, while larger depressions excavated by player's cleats (or the soil clods themselves) are impediments which tend to produce an errant bounce. Furthermore, if a ball does contact a 

```{r corkboard-concept, eval=T, fig.cap="The \"cleat-in, cleat-out\" effect ensures predictable ball response."}
knitr::include_graphics('images/illustrations/cleatmarks/corkboard_concept.png')
```

The transition of a single infield from the ideal "corkboard" state to a condition permitting more disturbance can be described as a brittle-ductile transition. Such a transition is observed with temperature changes in materials such as glass, hydrocarbons, and metals. The brittle-ductile transition of soil is governed not by temperature but by water content. 

Yield must occur for a player’s cleats to penetrate the soil surface. The mode of yield depends on the water content and the packing arrangement of the soil particles. Yield may be one of two types:

1. brittle yield: microcracks propagate through the soil skeleton, eventually coalescing to fracture the soil mass into discrete fragments. These clods adjust their positions to accommodate the cleats and are usually ejected from the depression as the shoe releases. Crumbling or cracking of soil is controlled by the distribution of imperfections or “weakest links” in the soil matrix @Dexter2004.

or

2. ductile yield: soil particles are re-arranged to accommodate the cleat, but the soil mass behaves as a continuum. The remolded zone around the indentation is likely to be small and more uniform with space [@Deepa2013].The terms ductile and plastic^[from the Greek _plastikos_, "to mold or form"] are used synonymously.  

In general, brittle deformation attenuates less energy than ductile deformation. Ductile behavior is usually associated with higher mechanical strain and more generation of heat [@Kuipers1984; @Perez2017]

The transition of fine-grained soil between brittle and plastic states was first outlined by the Swedish chemist Albert Atterberg [@Atterberg1911; @Atterberg1974]. Atterberg recognized the importance of quantifying plasticity. His test methods are described further in the \@ref(lab-methods-review) section. 

A second important consequence of the soil's plasticity is that if a ball _does_ contact a cleat indentation, the surface will deform a second time. Any change to the ball's trajectory will be minimal. This scenario is preferred to a more rigid collision in which the ball is re-directed, possibly leading to a misplay or injury. 



It requires a combination of plasticity and stiffness: the soil must readily deform around the cleats so that they are not rejected, but it must also provide enough resistance to prevent the athlete from sliding. 

The desired degree of stiffness may differ according to the level of play; lower stiffness may be preferred for a youth playing surface while professional-level fields require more resistance to the forces imposed by the larger athletes.  

In summary, the infield skin is a crucial component of both baseball competition and business operations. The grounds crew expends tremendous effort to maintain the infield skin within its ideal range of water content. The goal is to produce a stiff but plastic soil consistency which leads to the corkboard effect.  It is emphasized that at present, the corkboard effect is a solely qualitative description of soil behavior and no metrics exist for its study.

### Research on infield surface performance 

@Goodall2005 is the only published account of research on infield soil mixtures. The authors installed several soils which were commercially available within their region. 

@Brosnan2008a surveyed the surface conditions of the infield skin on extant playing fields at three maintenance levels. Particle size analyses were performed on soil sampled from each infield skin. The USDA soil texture of those samples is plotted in \@ref(fig:brosnan-survey-usda). These soils were sampled from the upper 13 mm and contained large granules of calcined clay infield conditioner; therefore, the texture measured with this method is coarser than the "true" texture of the base soil. 

```{r brosnan-survey-usda, eval=T, echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Infield soils suyveyed by Brosnan (2008a)", fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}

knitr::include_graphics('images/brosnan_survey_PSA.PNG')

```


Additionally, Brosnan et al. published research on the infield skin's role in athlete-to-surface interactions [-@Brosnan2009] and ball-to-surface interactions [-@Brosnan2011]. Bulk density (&rho;~bulk~) was shown to influence surface properties, although the range of bulk densities tested (1.2-1.8 Mg m^-3^) was beneath values typically encountered on infield skins (author's personal observation; data not shown).

However, the work of Brosnan et al. [-@Brosnan2009; -@Brosnan2011] was performed on a single soil material and focused on construction and maintenance practices rather than mix design.

### Use of artificial soil mixtures on baseball infields

Baseball was first played in the early 19th century, but the definitive origins of the game are likely lost to history [@Walker1994]. The earliest recorded attempt to alter the physical properties of an infield soil was by Harry Wright in 1875. Wright and his contemporaries incorporated various materials into their infield soils to enhance stability, firmness, or drainage of the playing surface. Amendments included organic debris (straw, ashes) and and inorganic materials (sand, lime, cinders) [@Morris2007].

Infield soil mixes were produced off-site and imported beginning in the 1960s ?Zwasksa?.

## Soil behavior terminology and measures {#soil-behavior-fundamentals} 

Toughness is really the most defining feature of clay soil. 





## Design and properties of artificial soil mixtures {#artificial-soil-mixtures}

Natural soil materials are excavated and deliberately blended for many uses. Potting mixes and green roof media are the largest means of production by volume (reference ??). The purpose of blending multiple soil materials is to create a product having properties not exhibited by any naturally occurring soil material. Even if the desired properties _could_ be found in a single naturally occurring material, the properties of natural soils are subject to spatial variation. In such a scenario, the properties of the mixture can be held constant simply by adjusting the ratio of the components. 

The Atterberg limits and unconfined compression testing are the primary means which have been used to charazcterize soil mixtures. These mixtures may contain two components(sand and clay), or three components (sand and two separate types of clay soil)




## Laboratory methods for evaluating soil behavior and physical properties {#lab-methods-review} 



### Particle size analysis

### Compaction tests

### Compression and shear strength tests

### Atterberg limits

#### Origins of the test methods
A common definition of plasticity is the tendency of a material to deform under an applied load, without fracturing into multiple pieces, and to retain its new shape when the load is removed [@Andrade2011] . The earliest test methods for soil plasticity were developed by Atterberg -@Atterberg1911, -@Atterberg1974. Atterberg noted that although plasticity is easy to observe, the phenomenon does not lend itself to simple measurement. He showed that the consistency of the soil was determined by its water content, and he reasoned that soil was plastic only within a finite range of water content, which differed for every soil. The upper water content boundary was defined as the flow limit, at which two batches of soil paste flowed together when jarred, and the lower water content boundary was defined as the rolling limit, at which the soil could no longer be rolled into thin threads. Atterberg called the difference between these two characteristic water contents the “plasticity number” (now known as the plasticity index or PI). He defined five other thresholds of soil behavior, though the others are not commonly used today. 

Atterberg deemed the plasticity number as the most reliable means of measuring plasticity, though upon reading his work one senses a reluctance to accept this simple number as a fully adequate measure of such a complex phenomenon. He pointed out that his ‘plasticity number’ provides no information amount of plastic strain incurred during deformation, nor does it enumerate the stress required to impart the deformation. He considered the effort needed to deform the soil a separate property, which translates to English as ‘viscosity;’ this property was later termed ‘toughness’ by @Casagrande1932. 

The value of Atterberg’s work has never been fully realized in his own discipline of soil science. However, the utilty of his test methods was clear to those in the then-novel field of geotechnical engineering. @Terzaghi1926 and @Casagrande1932 modified and standardized the Atterberg limit tests, leading to their widespread adoption for the design and control of earthworks projects. @Terzaghi1926 acknowledged the arbitrary nature of the tests, yet emphasized their value as a preliminary soil classification tool. He scorned qualitative definitions of soil behavior and favored the use of quantitative descriptions:

> “Every engineer should develop the habit of expressing the plasticity and grain-size characteristics of soils by numerical values rather than adjectives…..the degree of plasticity should be indicated by the estimated value of the plasticity index and not by the words ‘trace of plasticity’ or ‘highly plastic.’ ” 
@Terzaghi1996

#### Mechanics of the liquid limit test

The liquid limit test described by @Atterberg1911 required the soil to be agitated manually, introducing an unacceptable degree of operator dependence. The test method was first standardized by @Casagrande1932. The Casagrande method uses a brass cup fixed to a rotating cam, which agitates the soil paste by dropping the cup against a hard rubber base of specified height. A recent survey by @Haigh2016 supports Casagrande’s warning that the stiffness of the rubber base can significantly affect the results obtained with this method in addition to the device’s geometry and operator technique,.

An alternative test device for liquid limit determination was adopted by BS ______ (reference from Holtz et al. ?? )

#### Mechanics of the plastic limit test

Current protocols for the plastic limit include ASTM D4318, AASHTO T 90, and B.S. 1377. In the test, a soil is first wetted to the liquid limit to encourage full saturation. After performing the liquid limit test, a ~10 g sample of soil is gradually dried by gentle blow drying and re-molding with the operator’s fingers. Once the soil can be molded without sticking to the operator’s skin, the soil is rolled into a thread of 3 mm diameter, broken apart, and pressed into a new lump. This process is repeated until the soil crumbles when the rolling action is applied. 

@Terzaghi1926 introduced the use of a fixed thread diameter. Recently, the significance of the thread diameter has been questioned [@Barnes2013]. The stability of the soil thread is related to the maximum particle diameter and the rolling technique, and (Barnes, 2013) argued that emphasis should be shifted away from a specific thread diameter and toward observation of the thread during the test. 
Efforts have been made to improve the plastic limit test. The following section describes alternative test methods developed to improve upon the original thread-rolling method. 

Most attempts to improve the plastic limit test have focused on mechanizing the thread-rolling procedure. Test operators utilize different combinations of force, speed, and displacement when rolling the soil. Collectively these variables were termed ‘rolling path’ by [@Barnes2013]. @Bobrowski1992 described a simple apparatus to aid the operator in producing a thread of precisely 3.2 mm. The device consists of a flat plexiglass plate which is used to roll the thread, rather than the operator’s hand. (Bobrowski and Griekspoor, 1992) also state that paper should be affixed to the base of the device to prevent the thread from sliding and to expedite the drying process. Use of this device is allowed, but not mandated, in the current version of ASTM D4318. This device has been criticized by (Barnes, 2013), who cited the data of (Rashid et al., 2008) to assert the rolling device produces excessively rapid drying and eliminates the soil thread from the view of the operator. 

A fully mechanized thread rolling apparatus was developed by (Temyingyong et al., 2002). Their device used two acrylic plates similar to (Bobrowski and Griekspoor, 1992) and added a DC motor to apply the rolling action. The DC voltage was adjusted to control the rolling speed, and the downward force was altered by the addition of weights to the upper plate. They found that the initial diameter of the soil mass explained a larger amount of variation in the test result than did factors which might be ascribed to the subjective manual method (speed and pressure). The device still appears to be a significant improvement over the hand-rolling method; unfortunately, the device is not commercially available and its use has not been adopted by governing bodies. 
Barnes (2009) introduced a novel thread-rolling apparatus which allows precise control of the load applied to the soil thread. The device comprises two stainless steel plates: a fixed base and an upper loading plate which is manually oscillated. The load is adjusted by sliding a weight ballast along the side of the device opposite the handle. The further the ballast weight is from a pivot point, the lesser the load on the soil thread. The device is still operated by hand and a constant rate of rolling must be maintained through careful operation. A thin smear of petrolatum is used on the stainless steel plates to encourage extrusion of the soil thread. A number of other useful properties have been developed with this device, as described in the section of this review on soil toughness. 
Moreno-Marato and Alonso-Azcàrate described a plastic limit test in a soil thread is bent rather than rolled. The soil is wetted to a moldable consistency and flattened to ~3 mm.  A special slicing tool is used to create a rectangular prism of soil having precise dimensions of 3 mm x 3mm x 50 mm. The specimen is then rounded into a cylindrical thread using the same tool. The thread is carefully bent about its center, which is anchored around a stainless steel cylinder. When the thread begins to crack, a caliper is used to measure the distance between the two ends of the thread. The test is repeated for at least two other water contents and the water content of the threads is plotted against the displacement with segmented regression. The shallower segment is extrapolated to zero displacement and this water content is taken as the plastic limit. 

Moreno-Marato and Alonso-Azcàrate also described a faster version of their original thread-bending test. In this version only a single thread is prepared and its displacement and water content are extrapolated to zero displacement using an empirical equation. This test meets the original requirements of any plastic limit test which could replace the current method, namely:

1.	Rapid
2.	repeatable
3.	Operator-independent






#### Attempts to improve Atterberg limit methods 

Many soil tests have been developed with the goal of supplanting the Atterberg limits. However, due to the success and the abundance of data which has accumulated using these test methods, they are unlikely to be abandoned. 

Most criticism of the Atterberg limit tests center around operator technique.
