## Function and performance of baseball infields {#infield-performance} 

In baseball and softball, athletes engage with the playing surface in two ways: directly (by running, pivoting, and sliding) and indirectly (by fielding batted balls).

Existing research on this topic is relatively scant. This section describes the few published research studies and outlines the general goals of a baseball grounds manager.


### Qualitative description of the importance of the infield

Portions of a baseball field are termed **skin** if they comprise bare soil rather than natural grass or synthetic turf. The pitcher's mound and the area immediately surrounding home plate are considered distinct; these are constructed and maintained somewhat differently from the infield skin. However, this thesis will not treat the mound or home plate areas in detail, so in this document the terms "skin" and "infield skin" are used interchangeably. 

A full-size baseball field occupies ~ `r round(sum(pnc_areas$total_area_ha), 0)` ha. Roughly `r DescTools::RoundTo(x = turf_area_pct, multiple = 5)`% of this total area is surfaced with natural turfgrass or synthetic turf. An additional ~ `r DescTools::RoundTo(x = wt_area_pct, multiple = 5)`% is occupied by the warning track, which is alerts players that they are nearing the wall by its changing feel underfoot. Only about `r DescTools::RoundTo(x = skin_area_pct, multiple = 5)`% of the total playing surface is occupied by the infield skin.

<!-- I like the passage below, and I did spend a few hours finding the data/reference....but not sure it fits here. Thus I am saving it but commenting out. -->

<!-- It is in the defense's interest to encourage the offense to hit as many ground balls as possible, and this heightens the importance of the infield skin. In Major League Baseball (MLB), the average ground ball produces 0.04 runs while causing 0.80 outs. In contrast, the average ball hit in the air creates 0.23 runs and 0.62 outs. Therefore, on a runs-per-outs basis, a fly ball is nearly _8 times_ as valuable to the offense as a ground ball [@Carruth2010].  -->

To motivate the significance of the infield skin, consider Figures \@ref(fig:player-locations)-\@ref(fig:labor-per-area).^[Data used to compute the values in Figure \@ref(fig:labor-per-area) are compiled in the Appendix, see Table \@ref(tab:labor-per-area-tab)] All the offensive players, the four infielders, and the pitcher and catcher are standing on skinned areas. A large majority of important plays occur here, so the funds and effort devoted to maintaining this area are disproportionately large.

<!-- Need to get rid of the extra toughness verbiage and possibly make this its own section  -->

At the professional level, great efforts are made to sustain the infield in a playable condition. If a game is cancelled due to field conditions, the host franchise stands to lose several hundred thousand dollars. Therefore, every attempt is made to keep the field in a playable condition and complete the game. At the youth level, most revenue is also driven by concessions and repeated cancellations of tournaments or games may undermine the sustinability of the organization's finances. Many facilities generate a large portion of annual revenue over only a handful of concentrated events (for example, a 3-day tournament). 

The median MLB player salary in 2019 was x , with x players earning over $20 million. In a very real sense, elite athletes bodies are the most valued asset of an MLB franchise. Every effort must be made to ensure that player injuries are prevented so a team's investment is not squandered due to lost playing time. A safe infield surface is a must.


Toughness is an important property of an infield soil. When the soil offers adequate resistance to foot traffic, play may continue during rain. Once the resistance is lowered enough to make footing unsafe, the game is halted, and the grounds crew covers the field with an impermeable tarp to prevent further saturation. Rain delays and postponements lead to lost revenue and create schedule conflicts at both the professional and recreational levels. Moreover, deployment of the tarp during rainfall is dangerous and physically difficult.
Even when weather conditions are favorable, high toughness allows the groundskeeper a wider range of water contents to provide excellent playability. This minimizes mistakes when hand-watering the infield. 

The groundskeeper is unable to add water to the infield once the game has begun. In hot and dry weather., the soil dries and becomes excessively hard as the game progresses, affecting ball response and also inducing brittle bulking from cleat (Ch. __). Therefore soil toughness also allows the soil to retain its plastic behavior as soil moisture is reduced.



The main surface properties of interest to the athlete (and therefore to the grounds manager) are footing and ball response. Each can be further subdivided. 

#### Footing 

##### Traction

Traction allows the athlete to run, change directions, and perform other maneuvers without slipping, sliding, or otherwise losing control. Traction is distinct from planar friction because of the presence of studs or other gripping aids on the players' footwear [@McNitt1997a]. Even when using machine tests (rather than human subjects), measuring traction is complicated by nonlinear interactions between surface type, shoe type, and loading weights [@Nigg1990]. Excessive rotational traction is associated with lower extremity injuries, but traction differences among shoe types are often larger than those across surface types [@Serensits2014]. Clear-cut thresholds separating acceptable and unaccpetable traction have not been established.

Most athletic field research has focused on natural grass and synthetic turf. There are two published accounts of traction measurements on infield skin surfaces. 

@Goodall2005 measured traction on plots constructed from 5 different soils blended with 4 rates of calcined clay. Higher traction levels were reported for silty and loamy soils than for sandier soils. Mixing the soil with calcined clay prior to plot construction had no effect on traction. No relationship was found between traction and water content, although only 3 water contents were tested.

@Brosnan2011 measured traction on research plots of the same infield soil subjected to various treatments. Traction was increased by soil compaction and decreased by surficial additions of calcined clay. 

##### The brittle-ductile transition and the "corkboard effect" {#corkboard-section}

Minimal surface disruption is a crucial element of infield quality. A smooth playing surface ensures the game's outcome is decided by the players' performance alone and not influenced by chance events such as an errant ball bounce. 

Grounds managers consider ideal infield performance as follows: an athlete's studded footwear readily penetrates the soil at footstrike. The soil provides adequate resistance as the athlete completes his or her maneuver. The cleats release from the surface without separating any soil solids from the zone surrounding them. No material adheres to the studs or sole of the shoe. Thus, surface deformation is limited to a small indentation matching the shape of the stud. This phenomenon is known as “cleat-in, cleat-out” or "the corkboard effect^[named for its similarity to the experience of removing a thumbtack from a bulletin board.].“ In contrast, a poor-quality infield is one on which larger clods of soil are readily chipped out of the surface or easily fragmented into powder. 

Figure \@ref(fig:corkboard-concept) depicts the importance of the corkboard phenomenon. Small, narrow cleat indentations are unlikely to deflect a ball from its initial path, while larger depressions excavated by player's cleats (or the soil clods themselves) are impediments which tend to produce an errant bounce. 

```{r corkboard-concept, eval=T, fig.cap="(A) The \"cleat-in, cleat-out\" effect ensures predictable ball response. (B) Cleat indentations and soil clods inhibit a smooth and predictable ball path."}
knitr::include_graphics('images/illustrations/cleatmarks/corkboard_concept.png')
```

A given infield soil moves between these states as its water content changes. This change in state is formally termed the brittle-ductile transition. The brittle-ductile transition is examined further in the \@ref(lab-methods-review) section, but a brief description is provided below to establish its important link to infield performance. 

A skilled grounds crew takes great care to maintain the soil at the desired moisture. Water is manually added with hoses, and rain is kept off using a large tarpaulin. Soil water content can only be controlled during field preparation; after the game begins, no further adjustments can be made and weather conditions determine the rate of water loss or gain.

Grounds managers have observed that some soils undergo the brittle-ductile transition rapidly, while other soils can withstand a longer drying period before the behavior change occurs. Therefore, it seems plausible that infield soils could be designed to maximize the range of water content over which the corkboard phenomenon will persist.

Some amount of yield must occur for a player’s cleats to penetrate the soil surface. The mode of yield depends on the water content and the packing arrangement of the soil particles. Yield may be one of two types:

1. brittle yield: microcracks propagate through the soil skeleton, eventually coalescing to fracture the soil mass into discrete fragments. These clods adjust their positions to accommodate the cleats and are usually ejected from the depression as the shoe releases. Crumbling or cracking of soil is controlled by the distribution of imperfections or “weakest links” in the soil matrix [@Dexter2004]. In general, brittle deformation attenuates less energy than ductile deformation [@Kuipers1984].

or

2. ductile yield: soil particles are re-arranged to accommodate the cleat, but the soil mass behaves as a continuum. The remolded zone around the indentation is likely to be small and more uniform with space [@Deepa2013]. Ductile behavior is usually associated with higher mechanical strain and more generation of heat [@Perez2017]. The terms ductile and plastic^[from the Greek _plastikos_, "to mold or form"] are used synonymously.

A second important consequence of a ductile yield mode is that if a batted baseball _does_ contact a cleat indentation, the surface will deform a second time. Changes to the ball's trajectory will be minimal. This scenario is preferred to a more rigid collision in which the ball is re-directed, possibly leading to a misplay or injury (Figure \@ref(fig:corkboard-concept)). 

It is emphasized that no scientific investigations of the corkboard effect have been performed. It is a solely qualitative description of soil behavior, and at present no metrics exist for its study. 

### Ball response

The reaction of a baseball upon contact with the surface plays a key role in the outcome of competition (recall Figures \@ref(fig:labor-per-area)-\@ref(fig:batted-ball-density)). As for footing, limited research is available on infield ball response. 

@Goodall2005 is the only published account of controlled research on multiple infield soils. The authors installed 5 soils which were commercially available within the northeastern United States. Static and dynamic ball friction were measured along with traction and other soil properties. The authors found that increases in water content raised the coefficients of static and dynamic friction between the ball and the soil surface. The increase was likely due to greater ball penetration, increasing the contact area between the ball and the surface and also prolonging their interaction. @Goodall2005 suggested that surface pace may be more related to friction than to hardness. This agrees with intuition because the main component of a ground ball's velocity is horizontal (nearly coplanar with the surface), favoring the importance of horizontal friction rather than vertical rebound. Incorporation of calcined clay (particle size 0.5 - 2 mm) also decreased friction, especially for finer-textured soils.

Brosnan et al. studied the effects of construction and maintenance activities on infield surface pace [-@Brosnan2011]. Higher bulk density (&rho;~bulk~) increased surface pace, although the range of bulk densities tested (1.2-1.8 Mg m^-3^) was beneath values typically encountered on infield skins (author's personal observation; data not shown). Water content was negatively correlated with surface pace, but no attempt was made to intentionally alter water content among plots. This study was performed on a single soil material.

The effect of ball spin may be large or small depending on the playing surface properties. If the ball-surface friction coefficient is high, the ball will roll through impact and its release angle will be altered (Figure \@ref(fig:daish-spin-release-angle)). The new spin rate will be determined by the incoming velocity and the friction coefficient. Sidespin imparted by the bowler will readily grip the surface and alter its horizontal path [@Daish1972]. Alternatively, when friction is low, the ball will skid through impact and retain some of its original spin.

```{r daish-spin-release-angle, fig.cap="Initial spin will influence a ball's release angle following impact. Adapted from Daish, 1972."}

knitr::include_graphics("images/illustrations/ball_spin_effect/daish_fig_9.2_redraw.pdf")

```


When soil stiffness is low, the ball produces a notable deformation of the pitch. This prolongs the duration of the impact and gives friction more time to operate. As the ball releases, it rolls up the saucer-like depression created by the impact. This yields a slightly steeper release angle relative to that of a more rigid soil surface (Figure \@ref(fig:ball-indentation-release-angle)).  

```{r ball-indentation-release-angle, fig.cap="A. A rigid soil surface produces a lower release angle, provided no imperfections are present in the surface. B. A surface with lower stiffness encourages the ball to roll out of the shallow depression created by impact, leading to a slightly steeper release angle."}
knitr::include_graphics('images/illustrations/ball_indentation_release_angle/ball_indentation_release_angle.pdf')
```


Infield soil bear some similarity to cricket pitches and these have been researched more extensively. Ball response is influenced by soil bulk density, clay content, water content, organic matter, and particle size distribution [@Baker2006].

A laboratory study on surface friction of cricket soils was made by @Adams2001a. This experiment mixed the same clayey soil with 6 types of coarse amendments. All final mixes had sand contents between 30 and 40% by mass. Ball-to-surface friction was highest for the mix containing sand between 125-60 &mu;m. Lower friction was measured for soils with coarser or finer amendments. Using a suede-type leather increased friction relative to polished leather, implying that the degree of wear on the ball may influence surface pace.  



### Summary of the infield skin's value

The infield skin is a crucial component of baseball's competitive and business operations. A professional grounds crew expends significant effort to maintain the soil water content within this relatively narrow range. An ideal infield surface exhibits a combination of plasticity and stiffness. The soil must readily deform around the cleats so that they are not rejected, but it must also provide enough resistance to prevent the athlete from sliding.

### Use of artificial soil mixtures on baseball infields

Baseball was first played in the early 19th century, but the definitive origins of the game are likely lost to history [@Walker1994]. The earliest recorded attempt to alter the physical properties of an infield soil was by Harry Wright in 1875. Wright and his contemporaries incorporated various materials into their infield soils to enhance stability, firmness, or drainage of the playing surface. Amendments included organic debris (straw, ashes) and and inorganic materials (sand, lime, cinders) [@Morris2007].

Infield soil mixes were produced off-site and imported beginning in the 1960s ?Zwasksa?.

Popularity of engineered infield mixes has grown markedly since 2005 and today the majority of professional stadia utilize an engineered soil for their infield skin. 


## Laboratory tests of soil behavior and physical properties {#lab-methods-review} 

Ideally, researchers and practitioners could measure all soil properties of interest on an unlimited number of samples. In practice, this is prevented by time constraints and cost. Simpler tests are commonly used as surrogate markers to model the soil's actual properties in the field. The methodology of these tests has been subjected to considerable study because much is riding on their precision and accuracy. This section summarizes the development and evaluation of laboratory test methods pertinent to infield soils. 

### Atterberg limits

#### Origins of the test methods

The earliest test methods for soil plasticity were developed by Atterberg [-@Atterberg1911; -@Atterberg1974]. 
A commonly recited definition of plasticity is the tendency of a material to deform under an applied load, without fracturing into multiple pieces, and to retain its new shape when the load is removed [@Andrade2011]. 
Atterberg noted that although plasticity is easy to observe, the phenomenon does not lend itself to simple measurement. 
He showed that the consistency of the soil was determined by its water content, and he reasoned that soil was plastic only within a finite range of water content, which differed for every soil.


The upper water content boundary was defined as the flow limit, at which two batches of soil paste flowed together when jarred, and the lower water content boundary was defined as the rolling limit, at which the soil could no longer be rolled into thin threads. 
Atterberg called the difference between these two characteristic water contents the “plasticity number” (now known as the plasticity index or PI). 
He defined five other thresholds of soil behavior, though the others are not commonly used today. 
 

Atterberg deemed the plasticity number as the most reliable means of measuring plasticity, though one senses his reluctance to accept this simple number as a fully adequate measure. 
Atterberg pointed out that his ‘plasticity number’ provided no information amount of plastic strain incurred during deformation, nor does it enumerate the stress required to impart the deformation.
He considered the effort needed to deform the soil a separate property, which translates to English as ‘viscosity;’ this property was later termed ‘toughness’ by @Casagrande1932. 


The value of Atterberg’s work has never been fully realized in his own discipline of soil science.
However, the utilty of his test methods was clear to those in the then-novel field of geotechnical engineering. 
@Terzaghi1926 and @Casagrande1932 modified and standardized the Atterberg limit tests, leading to their widespread adoption for the design and control of earthworks projects. 
@Terzaghi1926 acknowledged the arbitrary nature of the tests, yet emphasized their value as a preliminary soil classification tool. 
He scorned qualitative definitions of soils and favored the use of quantitative descriptions:

> “Every engineer should develop the habit of expressing the plasticity and grain-size characteristics of soils by numerical values rather than adjectives…..the degree of plasticity should be indicated by the estimated value of the plasticity index and not by the words ‘trace of plasticity’ or ‘highly plastic.’ ” <br> \- @Terzaghi1996

Atterberg's original 5 consistency limits included the following distinctions, ordered from highest to lowest water content:

1. Upper limit of viscous flow - soil flows easily, similar to water
2. Lower limit of viscous flow - soil flows when agitated in a bowl
3. Adhesion limit - soil no longer adheres to a metal implement
4. Rolling limit - soil can no longer be rolled into a thread
5. Cohesion limit - lumps of soil can be no longer pressed together with one's fingers
 
Of these limits, only (2) and (4) are in use today and they are termed the liquid and plastic limits respectively. The following sections detail the mechanics underlying these tests and their limitations. 

#### Methods in current use 

##### Liquid limit

The liquid limit test described by @Atterberg1911 lacked reproducibility because it required the operator to manually agitate the soil. 
A mechanical test method was first presented by @Casagrande1932. 
The method has undergone little alteration up to the present. 
The Casagrande apparatus comprises a brass cup fixed to a rotating cam. A groove is cut in the soil paste. 
The soil paste is agitated by dropping the cup against a hard rubber base until the soil begins to flow and the groove closes over a span of 1.25 cm (1/2 in).
Casagrande arbitrarily defined the liquid limit as the water content needed to close the groove after 25 blows. 
Several trials are made and the water content is plotted against the natural logarithm of blow count. 
The water content to produce 25 blows is interpolated from this curve. 

Several fall-cone methods have been proposed for determining the liquid limit.^[These methods are purportedly traceable to the Russian researcher Piotr Vasilje @, although the author has been unable to verify this claim in peer-reviewed literature] 
The fall-cone methods have several advantages to the Casagrande method and have been widely adopted internationally. 
Advantages of the fall-cone methods include:

1. Less operator dependency [@Sherwood1970a]
2. Provide a more straightforward estimate of the soil's undrained shear strength [@Haigh2016]
3. Ability to determine the liquid limit for some low-plasticity soils which cannot be tested with the Casagrande cup [@Sherwood1970a]

The British Standard is the most widely-used fall-cone method and considers the liquid limit as the water content at which an 80g cone with a single-sided angle of 30&deg; penetrates the sample to a depth of 20 mm @BS13771990.
Unfortunately, other nations have developed similar methods with different cone masses and angles and comparing results is challenging. 
Empirical correlations have been established to convert between the Casagrande LL and the fall-cone LL. 
For soils with LL under 100, the two methods give good agreement but for higher-LL soils the cone yields lower LL values [@Holtz; @OKelly2017]. 

##### Plastic limit

Atterberg's original plastic limit test remains essentially unchanged. @Terzaghi1926 introduced the use of a fixed thread diameter of 1/8" (3.2 mm), although its significance has been recently questioned [@Barnes2013]. The stability of the soil thread is related to the maximum particle diameter and the rolling technique, and @Barnes2013 argued that emphasis should be shifted away from a specific thread diameter and toward observation of the thread during the test. 
The soil is wetted to a moldable state and rolled into a thread. 
The thread is broken up into pieces, remolded, and rolled out again. 
The plastic limit is the water content at which the soil can no longer be rolled out into a thread of 3.2 mm diameter. 

Standard test methods typically pair the plastic and liquid limit tests. In the United States the relevant standards are @ASTMD43182018 and . The tests are essentially equivalent.



### Nature and magnitude of error associated with Atterberg limits

Atterberg limit tests can be performed rapidly and require little equipment or consumables. Unfortunately there are multiple sources of error associated with the test. This section outlines research on the precision and accuracy of the tests. 

### Sherwood study 

@Sherwood1970 conducted a detailed investigation on the precision and accuracy of laboratory soil tests. Three soils termed B, G, and W were pulverized and riffled repeatedly to ensure their homogeneity. The samples were sent to 41 laboratories for analysis. The test were also replicated by multiple operators at the Road Research Laboraroty and by a single operator to compare the repeatability by various means of replication. The battery of tests included particle size analysis by hydrometer, specific gravity, Proctor-style compaction, liquid limit, and plastic limit.


```{r produce plots and values from Sherwood 1970}
source("supplemental_R_scripts/Sherwood_1970_plots.R")
```

The liquid limit involves a mechanical device whereas the plastic limit test introduces a greater degree of operator judgment. 
One might expect better agreement for the liquid limit and this is borne out in the data. Figure \@ref(fig:sherwood-across-labs) shows a wider spread for the plastic limit data points. 
The coefficient of variation was remarkably consistent across soils: the three materials had COV values of `r  summary_covs_across_labs$PL[1]`, `r  summary_covs_across_labs$PL[2]`, and `r  summary_covs_across_labs$PL[3]`% for the liquid limit and `r  summary_covs_across_labs$LL[1]`, `r  summary_covs_across_labs$LL[2]`, and `r  summary_covs_across_labs$LL[3]`% for the plastic limit. 
Evidently, the uncertainty associated with a single test result is not a function of soil type. 

Agreement was much better for operators trained in the same lab. 
Figure \@ref(fig:sherwood-across-operators) shows variation across eight individuals employed by the Road Research Laboratory at the time of the study. 
Both the liquid and plastic limits are clustered tightly around their mean values.
Reproducibility was better still for a single operator (Figure \@ref(fig:sherwood-single-operator)).

```{r sherwood-across-labs, fig.cap='Atterberg limit test results can vary substantially across labs.'}

```


```{r sherwood-single-operator, fig.cap='Variation of replicate Atterberg limit results is small when the tests are conducted by the same experienced operator.'}

sherwood_variability_plots$single_operator_table1
```

@Sherwood1970 demonstrated that the coefficient of variation (COV) among results from a single RRL operator was a small fraction of the COV for the inter-laboratory study. Therefore, Atterberg limit tests are quite repeatable so long as they are performed by an experienced operator with careful workmanship (Figure \@ref(fig:sherwood-overall-comparison)). 

```{r sherwood-overall-comparison, fig.cap='Reproducibility is excellent for a single operator, fair among operators in the same lab, and relatively poor across laboratories.'}
att_lims_variation_sources_plot

```

Finally, a separate study by @Sherwood1970a showed that the fall-cone method has better inter-operator reproducibility. The coefficient of variation was about half that of the Casagrande method. 

```{r sherwood-cone-cup-comparison, fig.cap='The fall-cone method is less variable across operators than the Casagrande cup'}

```


Sherwood summarized the results of the round-robin testing with a warning about the validity of the tests:

>"The results of this investigation....are for the most part rather disturbing, since it is clear that none of them can be used without quite wide tolerances being placed on the values obtained."

However, he concluded with a more optimistic tone, surmising that results could be improved with better training and the instigation of a voluntary standard monitoring program:

>"Some
success
in this direction
has already
been
achieved
and the British
Standard
procedures
for all tests might well
be examined
to make
sure that sufficient detail is given and that
ambiguities
are removed."

The three chief sources of laboratory error include:

1. specimen preparation
2. proper function/calibration of test apparatus
3. operator technique

Each is outlined in the following sections. Note that these do not include sampling practices, which are carried out prior to laboratory testing and normally comprise a larger source of error than any laboratory procedure [@Brady2007]. 

##### Liquid limit: sources of error


###### Specimen preparation
The means by which a soil specimen is mixed and handled can affect the results obtained from physical tests. 

@Howell1997 performed compaction tests on sand-bentonite mixtures produced with different preparation methods. 
They showed that a longer "curing" time after adding water slightly increased the optimum water content for compaction (<sub>opt</sub>). 
The effect was small; %delta;w<sub>opt</sub> was only ~ 0.5% when using granular/pelletized bentonite and not detectable for powedered bentonite. 
The effect of mixing procedure was more apparent. 
Mixing water with the sand prior to adding the bentonite increased <sub>opt</sub> by up to 2% compared with mixing the soil components dry and adding the water last. &rho;<sub>max</sub> was also lower when the water was added before the bentonite. 
Evidently, the water was more apt to associate with the sand in the latter procedure. 

@Armstrong1986 tested 13 means of preparing soil specimens for Atterberg limit tests. 
They reported a 4 % water content increase of  in the liquid limit due to oven-drying at either 60 or 110 &degC. 
This was attributed to difficulty in re-hydrating the clay mineral surfaces and micropores. 
If the soil was oven-dried, the liquid limit was increased by curing the sample for 24 hours after adding water. 
A further but marginal LL increase was noted for a 48-hour cure time. 
The relevant finding is that soil specimens should not be oven-dried prior to testing and should be thoroughly wetted to near their liquid limit before beginning the test. 
@ASTMD43182018 prohibits drying above 60 &deg;C and requires a minimum 16-hour curing time. 

@Dumbleton1966a tested the effect of mixing duration on Atterberg limits of several soils. 
The liquid limit continued to increase for up to 3 hours of mixing time. 
The effect was only observed for specific soils, namely those containing iron-oxide cements. 
The cements were evidently degraded by the longer agitation time because non-cemented London clay showed no change after more mixing. 
No information was provided about the actual mixing procedure, though one could assume it was performed by hand with a spatula or similar tool. 



##### Condition of aparatus

@Casagrande1958 expressed regret that his original design did not quantitatively specify the rubber base's properties. 
This led to disparities among the devices produced by various manufacturers, and they yielded different liquid limits despite being otherwise identical. 

@Sherwood1970 concluded that so long as a standard test device is used, differences in operator technique comprise a larger source of error than the device itself. However, a recent survey by @Haigh2016 confirmed that the hardness and resilience of the rubber base does vary widely across national specifications. Even within a rubber type (hard or soft), the coefficient of variation in rubber hardness was around 20%. Analytical solutions by @Haigh2016 predict that a 20% deviation in base stiffness yields a change in the liquid limit of 2-3% of its value (i.e. coefficient of variation). This variability is similar to the standard deviation reported by an ASTM reproducibility study across 14 labs [@ASTMD43182018], suggesting a large amount of inter-laboratory variability could be due simply to variation in the rubber base properties of the devices employed. 

Assuming the device meets specification, the most common error sources with the Casagrande apparatus are a worn grooving tool and variability in in drop height caused by a loose locking screw [@Sherwood1970]. 
The drop height must be frequently calibrated to ensure accurate results [@ASTMD43182018].


##### Operator technique

The means by which the groove is cut and the rate at which the cam is agitated will affect the flow of the soil. 
Every effort must be made to maintain the tool in an orthogonal position to the cup surface throughout the action [@Casagrande1958]. The cam should be agitated at a constant rate of 2 blows per second [@ASTMD43182018].


#### Plastic limit: sources of error

Current protocols for the plastic limit include ASTM D4318, AASHTO T 90, and B.S. 1377. In the test, a soil is first wetted to the liquid limit to encourage full saturation. 
After performing the liquid limit test, a ~10 g sample of soil is gradually dried by gentle blow drying and re-molding. 
Once the soil can be molded without sticking to the operator’s skin, the soil is rolled into a thread of 3 mm diameter, broken apart, and pressed into a new lump. 
This process is repeated until the soil crumbles when the rolling action is applied. 


#### Attempts to improve plastic limit test

Most attempts to improve the plastic limit test have focused on mechanizing the thread-rolling procedure in hopes of improving its reproducibility across operators. Test operators utilize different combinations of force, speed, and displacement when rolling the soil. Collectively these variables were termed ‘rolling path’ by [@Barnes2013]. @Bobrowski1992 described a simple apparatus to aid the operator in producing a thread of precisely 3.2 mm. The device consists of a flat plexiglass plate which is used to roll the thread, rather than the operator’s hand. (Bobrowski and Griekspoor, 1992) also state that paper should be affixed to the base of the device to prevent the thread from sliding and to expedite the drying process. Use of this device is allowed, but not mandated, in the current version of ASTM D4318. This device has been criticized by (Barnes, 2013), who cited the data of (Rashid et al., 2008) to assert the rolling device produces excessively rapid drying and eliminates the soil thread from the view of the operator. 

A fully mechanized thread rolling apparatus was developed by (Temyingyong et al., 2002). Their device used two acrylic plates similar to (Bobrowski and Griekspoor, 1992) and added a DC motor to apply the rolling action. The DC voltage was adjusted to control the rolling speed, and the downward force was altered by the addition of weights to the upper plate. They found that the initial diameter of the soil mass explained a larger amount of variation in the test result than did factors which might be ascribed to the subjective manual method (speed and pressure). The device still appears to be a significant improvement over the hand-rolling method; unfortunately, the device is not commercially available and its use has not been adopted by governing bodies. 
Barnes (2009) introduced a novel thread-rolling apparatus which allows precise control of the load applied to the soil thread. The device comprises two stainless steel plates: a fixed base and an upper loading plate which is manually oscillated. The load is adjusted by sliding a weight ballast along the side of the device opposite the handle. The further the ballast weight is from a pivot point, the lesser the load on the soil thread. The device is still operated by hand and a constant rate of rolling must be maintained through careful operation. A thin smear of petrolatum is used on the stainless steel plates to encourage extrusion of the soil thread. A number of other useful properties have been developed with this device, as described in the section of this review on soil toughness. 
Moreno-Marato and Alonso-Azcàrate described a plastic limit test in a soil thread is bent rather than rolled. The soil is wetted to a moldable consistency and flattened to ~3 mm.  A special slicing tool is used to create a rectangular prism of soil having precise dimensions of 3 mm x 3mm x 50 mm. The specimen is then rounded into a cylindrical thread using the same tool. The thread is carefully bent about its center, which is anchored around a stainless steel cylinder. When the thread begins to crack, a caliper is used to measure the distance between the two ends of the thread. The test is repeated for at least two other water contents and the water content of the threads is plotted against the displacement with segmented regression. The shallower segment is extrapolated to zero displacement and this water content is taken as the plastic limit. 

Moreno-Marato and Alonso-Azcàrate also described a faster version of their original thread-bending test. In this version only a single thread is prepared and its displacement and water content are extrapolated to zero displacement using an empirical equation. This test meets the original requirements of any plastic limit test which could replace the current method, namely:

1.	Rapid
2.	repeatable
3.	Operator-independent

Many soil tests have been developed with the goal of supplanting the Atterberg limits. However, in the author's view, these tests are unlikely to be abandoned because of the abundance of data which has accumulated from their use and the speed with which they can be performed. 

### Toughness tests

Toughness is a conspicuous feature of clay soils. This section describes the nature of toughness and attempts to measure it for soils. 

In mechanics, toughness is the energy dissipated during a loading event. It is mathematically defined as the area beneath a stress-strain curve up to failure. Toughness bears units of energy per volume (i.e. work; SI units $\mathrm{frac{J}{m^3}}$) [@Mamlouk2006]. In other words, toughness is the total effort required to deform a specimen to its failure condition. The integral is traditionally computed over the entire material test, but the strain range may be abitrarily defined for a specific problem (e.g. @Barnes2013; @Barnes2013b).  

A large peak strength does not necessarily imply a material is tough. A brittle material may have a high strength, but because it fails at low strain the toughness is relatively low. Conversely, a ductile material which deforms to very high strain levels may be quite tough despite its low ultimate strength [@Mamlouk2006]. 

Many fine-textured soils exhibit ductile behavior, but their strength in this state varies widely. This observation is known by those who work intimately with clay in trades such as pottery production or earthworks. As @Casagrande1932 noted in his landmark Atterberg limits paper:

>“There is a wide variation in the shearing resistance of different soils at the plastic limit. This difference may be felt by hand when performing the plastic limit test on various soils....the toughness of a clay at its plastic limit may therefore be described as the maximum stiffness or shearing resistance which it can acquire without losing its plasticity.”

 
The plastic limit therefore reflects only the water content at which a drying soil becomes brittle, and on its own should not be considered a measure of soil strength or toughness. This distinction has been blurred in academic literature, where the plastic limit is sometimes reported as the water content corresponding to a particular value of cone penetration (e.g. @Whyte1982). Reported values of peak strength at the plastic limit differ by up to 2 orders of magnitude [@Haigh2013]. 

The literature on shear strength and compressive strength is rich, but these studies focus on the peak load at failure and give little mention to energy dissipation up to failure. In most engineering applications little to no strain is desired. A baseball field differs because a small amount of deformation to the soil is desirable (Section \@ref(#corkboard-section)). Few attempts have been made to measure soil toughness directly. 

Barnes published a series of papers descibing an apparatus which replicates the plastic limit hand-rolling procedure [@Barnes2009; @Barnes2013; @Barnes2013b; @Barnes2018]

@Casagrande derived an estimate of the toughness index ???? 

In the hypothetical sense any test which applies a known load and measures a deformation could be used to measure toughness. @Barnes2013 suggested his apparatus would correlate well with the Moisture Condition Value test, which is the logarithm of the number of blows needed to compact a fixed mass of soil to a pre-determined volume.


Data from @Barnes2013 and -@Barnes2018 have been re-analyzed by other authors to develop empirical equations for predicting toughness.

from other soil properties [@Moreno-Marato2018; @Vinod2017] and even used to suggest a new system for classifying soils based on toughness [@Moreno-Marato2021]. However, because the Barnes device is a unique apparatus, no attempts have been published to confirm its replicability across other operators or to compare its results with other means of measuring soil toughness. 

It must be acknowledged that while the Barnes apparatus marks a significant advance, it represents but one means of measuring soil toughness. Clays exhibit toughness during many types of strain, not only the harmonic thread-rolling typical of the plastic limit test which the Barnes device seeks to emulate. Similarly, the plastic liimit does not represent the true limit of ductile behavior; it merely establishes an arbitratry if useful threshold for a single type of deformation. Soil can exhibit ductile strain even when its water content lies below the plastic limit. This is readily observed when classifying soils with the USDA hand method, which involves making a ribbon with the thumb and fingers. The soil can still be "ribboned" but will crumble if rolled. 

### Particle size analysis

At the time of writing, particle size analysis is the only means of soil testing which has been applied to infield soils. Mechanical analysis is relatively rapid and inexpensive, and it has been used as a surrogate marker for nearly every aspect of soil science. A tremendous amount of data has accumulated with particle size analysis as its basis. It is useful to examine the principles which underlie the analysis and the development of the techniques, and to identify potential sources of error during the tests.


@Brosnan2008a surveyed the surface conditions of the infield skin on extant playing fields at three maintenance levels. Particle size analyses were performed on soil sampled from each infield skin. The USDA soil texture of those samples is plotted in \@ref(fig:brosnan-survey-usda). These soils were sampled from the upper 13 mm and contained large granules of calcined clay infield conditioner; therefore, the texture measured with this method is coarser than the "true" texture of the base soil.

## Design and properties of artificial soil mixtures {#artificial-soil-mixtures}

Natural soil materials are excavated and deliberately blended for many uses. Potting mixes and green roof media are the largest means of production by volume (reference ??). The purpose of blending multiple soil materials is to create a product having properties not exhibited by any naturally occurring soil material. Even if the desired properties _could_ be found in a single naturally occurring material, the properties of natural soils are subject to spatial variation. In such a scenario, the properties of the mixture can be held constant simply by adjusting the ratio of the components. 

The Atterberg limits and unconfined compression testing are the primary means which have been used to charazcterize soil mixtures. These mixtures may contain two components(sand and clay), or three components (sand and two separate types of clay soil)

### pasted from word 2021-1-28

An engineered soil is defined as an artificial mixture of two or more natural soils for a specific application. The purpose of manufacturing an engineered soil is to obtain a material which exhibits properties superior to those of any naturally occurring soil. 
Artificial mixtures of sand with clay have been studied extensively. Investigated properties include packing density, permeability, shear strength, pore size distribution, and Atterberg limits. 

#### Definition of the Transitional Fines Content
In a coarse-grained soil, applied loads are transmitted through a skeleton of grain-to-grain contacts. The behavior of the soil is relatively independent of water content. A minor addition of fine particles will not alter the soil’s behavior so long as the fines fit comfortably within the large voids.  Once sufficient fines are added, they begin to participate in the force chain and with further additions the coarse grains become completely suspended in a matrix of fines. At this point the soil’s behavior will be dominated by the fines and the coarse grains act only as inert inclusions. The percent fines by where the soil behavior changes from that of the sand to that of the fines has been termed the “transitional fines content.” 

Reported values of transitional fines content range from 15 to 45% by dry mass [reference??]. There is no universal mass-based fines percent which defines the TFC because (1) the transition depends on the behavioral threshold of interest (for example, compressibility, shear strength, or permeability), and (2), a unique ratio exists for every combination of coarse-grained and fine-grained components because particle packing depends on the grain-size distribution of each component, the plasticity of the fines, the means of compaction or consolidation, and the state of effective stress.(Zuo and Baudet, 2015) 

The TFC has been variously defined based on: derived values from phase relations and index properties(Thevanayagam, 1998; Monkul and Ozden, 2007; Cabalar, 2011), the minimum global void ratio in compaction experiments(Lade et al., 1998; Ueda et al., 2011), undrained shear strength(Thevanayagam, 1998; Vallejo and Mawby, 2000; Dafalla, 2013; Nagaraj, 2016; Cabalar and Mustafa, 2017; Kim et al., 2018), parameters of the normal compression line or critical state line,(Cabalar, 2011; Carrera et al., 2011; Shipton and Coop, 2012) and liquefaction potential(Lade and Yamamuro, 1997).



Importance of distinction between volumetric and mass relations
In an artificial mixture of two or more soils, the relative amounts of each components may be compared on a volumetric or mass basis. The dry mass of solids is considered a more absolute measure of the quantity of each component, as these never change despite fluctuations in water content or bulk density. The ratios or percentage to which the component fractions are normalized should also be made explicit. The most common means to express the amount of each component is to set the total dry mass of the mixture equal to 100% : 
% sand=g_sand/(g_sand+g_clay )
However, others have advocated for enumerating the amount of sand to the amount of clay. For example, if 40 grams sand are added to 100 grams clay, this mixture would be termed 40% sand. This approach is analogous to computing water content as the mass of water related to the mass of dry soil. It is scarcely used in scientific literature.   
% sand=g_sand/g_clay 
Mass-based ratios are the most rational basis for mixing and testing, yet the behavior of the soil is governed by particle-to-particle relations in physical space. Therefore volumetric relations provide a more accurate depiction of the soil’s behavior, especially when the mixture components have very different specific gravities. 

The importance of intergranular void ratio
An important variable in the behavior of sand-clay mixtures is the configuration of the sand grains within the bulk soil matrix. The term intergranular void ratio was introduced by (Thevanayagam, 1998) to enumerate the configuration of the coarse grains in a soil mixture. The intergranular void ratio is derived from phase relations (Fig __) by treating the solid fines as voids within the bulk volume, which is held equal to unity.
 
 The intergranular void ratio may be compared with the minimum and maximum void ratio of the pure sand as determined by standard test methods. When the intergranular void ratio exceeds that of the host sand, it is considered that the soil’s behavior will no longer be governed solely by the coarse grain contacts. 


Factors influencing the transitional fines content
Size ratio
TFC values may be computed analytically from phase relations and minimum/maximum void ratios, yet derived values rarely coincide with those observed in experiments(Zuo and Baudet, 2015). In practice, observed volumetric packing densities (i.e. volumetric solid fraction) are always lower than the theoretical maximum because the calculations rely on simplifying assumptions which are unlikely to be satisfied(Zuo and Baudet, 2015). These assumptions are:
	The fines are “infinitely small”
	The coarse grains are smooth spheres
	Both the coarse and fine soils are packed to their respective optimum densities  
Observed packing densities in experiments range from 60% to 95% of the theoretical maximum(Furnas, 931; McGeary, 1961; Zuo and Baudet, 2015). 
An important element of the discrepancy between calculations and experiments is the size ratio between the coarse and fine components (Lade et al., 1998; Ueda et al., 2011). The size ratio is given as: 
 R=〖D_50〗_sand/〖D_50〗_fines 
The agreement between calculation and experiment is enhanced with increasing size ratio(Lade et al., 1998; Zuo and Baudet, 2015). If the coarse and fine soils have similar mean grain sizes, mis-fitting and lodging of fines between the coarse grains is responsible for creating additional voids. (Lade et al., 1998) showed that when R < 7, an increase in R imparts a relatively steep increase in packing density. Additionally, (Lade et al., 1998) showed analytically that a void between closely packed spheres of equal sizes has a diameter of ~ 1/6.4 that of the large particles. Therefore, there is a fundamental reason for the abrupt change in slope at R~7. The effect is lessened once R > 7, and the observed void ratio approaches the theoretical maximum asymptotically. Numerical simulations indicate the intergranular void ratio practically independent of 〖D_50〗_fines when R > 100. (Ueda et al., 2011)

			Uniformity of each component
The theoretical maximum packing density of a two-component mixture is increased when the maximum density of each component is greater. If the mean grain size is suficintly different bewtewne the two components, a wider widening the particle size distribution within each individual component will increase the packing density of each component without causing the fines to interfere with packing of the sand. 

Number of mix components
As the number of components in the mixture increases, the achievable packing density asymptotically approaches the specific gravity of the solids (zero void space). A four-component mixture by (McGeary, 1961) achieved a volumetric packing density of 0.951 (less than 5 % porosity). This extreme density was only achieved in the experiments by first vibrating the coarsest component to its maximum density, then adding the next finer component and vibrating until it fully penetrated the remaining voids. 
Plasticity of fines
The majority of research on TFC mixtures has focused on sand mixed with nonplastic fines. This likely reflects the greater engineering liquefaction potential of silt and also the relative speed at which the experiments can be performed. Mixtures of sand with silt are easily vibrated to their maximum density in an air-dry condition, while investigations of sand mixed with plastic clay require more time- and labor-intensive proctor compaction methods. 
Plasticity index is positively correlated with optimum water content for compaction(Sridharan and Nagaraj, 2005; Verma and Kumar, 2019). Therefore, in a compaction experiment, a higher plasticity clay would be expected to have a lower mass percent of fines, as more of the intergranular space is occupied by water rather than clay solids. 
 

			Method of compaction/ compaction energy
Mixtures subjected to static compression in an oedometer exhibit typical void ratio vs. log pressure curves. When this method of volume reduction is used, higher ultimate density values are attained than when using dynamic compaction, such as in the standard and modified Proctor tests. The difference in packing can probably be attributed to more complete evacuation of air from the voids. 
Transitional fines content- how to define?
		Volume vs mass (again)
Maximum density
		Behavior- undrained strength? 

A qualitative definition of the transitional fines content is when the behavior of a soil mixture becomes more similar to the behavior of the fines alone than the sand alone. A transition in actual soil behavior, however defined, is of greater practical interest than a surrogate marker such as void ratio [which is more aptly considered a state parameter than an index property].



Atterberg limits of sand-clay mixtures
The Atterberg tests have been used to assess the behavior of sand-clay mixtures. Although the tests are intended to characterize silts and clays, the test results also reflect the size and shape of the sand fraction in an artificial sand-clay mixture.
This section summarizes research on the Atterberg limits of artificial soil mixtures. Two-component mixtures (sand with a single type of clay material) and three-component mixtures (sand with two forms of clay material) are both discussed. For brevity, in this section the term “clay” is used to mean the fine-grained soil component of the mixture and does not connote any particle size definition. 
___
The term “clay” connotes varied meanings to different fields. In this dissertation, in the spirit of brevity, I use the term “clay” in this dissertation in its colloquial sense- that is a fine-grained soil material that can be shaped and molded. When soil mixtures are made one does not typically consider only the fraction of mineral solids having < 2 μm equivalent Stoke’s diameter. Instead, the mix is made on the basis of a specified ratio between 2 or more soils which are combined.

Two-component mixtures of clay and coarse additions
Seed et al., 1964a (Seed et al., 1964)  investigated Atterberg limits of sand-clay mixtures. Three types of clay (kaolinite, illite, and Ca-bentonite) were mixed with varying amounts of sand. All of the sand was < 425 μm in accordance with the standard test methods. 
For the high-swelling bentonite, the liquid limits of the sand-clay mixtures were inversely proportional to sand content. In other words, the water content per unit clay material remained constant. This relationship was also observed for the illite clay. A linear relation was observed for the kaolinite clay up to 50 % sand, but the liquid limit test could not be performed on the 75 % sand-25 % kaolinite mixture, so whether the liner decline holds above 50 % sand could not be evaluated. 
The slopes of these liquid limit vs. sand content lines differed by clay type; the authors showed that the slope was in close agreement with the Skempton activity of the clay, computed as (LL/ % < 2 μm). This relationship also held regardless of whether a single clay was mixed with the sand or if the sand was mixed with two types of clay (further discussed in the following section). 
The plastic limit of the bentonite-sand mixtures also followed a linear relationship with increasing sand, up to the highest percent sand tested (75%). In contrast, the illite and kaolinite clays showed a linear relation only at lower sand contents. At sand content of 50% or higher, the plastic limits were higher than would be predicted by a simple linear regression line. This suggests the sand grains began to play a role in the soil’s behavior.
A precise estimate of the inflection point for the PL-sand content curve could not be established because of the small number of sand contents investigated. The authors tested only 4 sand contents for the illite clay and 3 sand contents for the kaolinite clay, so the precise terminus of a linear trend could have occurred anywhere between 25 and 75% sand. 

@Sivapullaiah1985 published similar findings on the effects of adding sand to pure clay materials. If the sand grains act solely as inert inclusions, the liquid limit of the sand-clay mixture should decrease in exact proportion to the sand content. @Sivapullaiah1985 termed this effect the “linear law of mixtures.” They showed that the linear law is only valid for sand-clay mixtures within a range of sand contents. Evidence is given as (1) liquid limits which are systematically higher than predicted by the linear law and (2) Plastic limits actually _increasing_ with greater sand content once 60% sand was reached.  The linear law was also shown to be invalid for mixes of bentonite with two types of silt in several ratios.
@Sivapullaiah1985 clearly demonstrated that the linear law is not valid over the full range of 0-100% clay, but only one data points was collected between 0 and 60% sand. At these low sand contents, the shape of the liquid limit vs. sand content curve (linear or curvilinear) cannot be definitively stated from their data. 
The effect of sand particle size on the behavior of sand-clay mixtures was also tested by @Sivapullaiah1985. The size of the added sand particles affected both the liquid and plastic limits. Mixes with coarser sand (425 μm – 150 μm) adhered more closely to the linear law of mixtures than finer sand containing only particles 150 μm – 75 μm. Mixes containing bentonite and silt (rather than sand) deviated further still from the linear law. 
@Sivapullaiah1985 also isolated the effect of sand particle shape on the Atterberg limits of sand-clay mixtures. Bentonite clay was mixed with equal amounts of either angular or round sand of the same particle size fraction (150 μm – 75 μm). Sand contents ranged from 20 - 95 %. There was no discernable difference in the liquid or plastic limit due to particle shape. 
 

Dumbleton and West (1966a, 1966b, 1970)
(Dumbleton, 1966) investigated the liquid and plastic limits of two types of clay mixed with 5 types of coarse particles in various quantities. Silt and sand additions reduced the liquid limit and plastic limit. On an absolute scale, the water content at the liquid limit was changed more substantially than the plastic limit. However, on a relative scale (i.e. compared to characteristic water contents of the pure clay), adding sand or silt produced a similar _relative_ change in both characteristic water contents. Their montmorillonite clay was more affected by sand additions than their kaolinite. This is somewhat contrary to other studies which find montmorillonite to be a more “active” clay mineral (citation). 
 
The degree of the coarse particles’ influence on the test results was inversely related to particle size. In other words, for the same percent coarse addition, the degree of influence on the plasticity of a mix was silt > fine sand > coarse sand. 
The shape of the coarse particles mixed with the clays also affected the results of @Dumbleton1966a. For the same mass percent of coarse addition, the increase in the plastic limit was platy mica silt > bulky quartz silt angular quartz sand > round quartz sand. The authors attributed the difference to irregularly-shaped particles having higher surface area and requiring more water to coat the particles. This finding contradicts that of @Sivapullaiah1985, whose data showed no difference between angular and round sands of the same sieve diameter. Were the experiment conducted to higher sand content, it is possible an effect of particle shape would have been observed. 

(Dumbleton and West, 1966) furthered their investigation of the coarse fraction’s influence on Atterberg limits. Increasing departure from spherical and round particles tended to raise both the liquid and plastic limits by roughly equivalent amounts. Although the coarse fraction had a measurable influence, the authors determined the nature of the clay material was the more important variable. 

@Barnes2013 tested mixes of London clay with sand (two different size fractions) or silt, in 10% increments of coarse particles from 0 to 100% clay.

Three-component mixtures of sand with two types of clay
The work of (Seed et al., 1964) on relatively pure clay minerals mixed with sand was discussed above. A more complex relationship was observed when two types of clay were mixed together before adding sand. Seed et al. also extended the problem to three-component mixes in which two types of clay were first combined in varying ratios and the resultant mixture further blended with different amounts of sand. The plastic and liquid limits of the mixtures did not lie on a linear interpolation between those of the pure clay endmembers. 
Three types of clay (kaolinite, illite, and Ca-smectite) were investigated. For mixes of kaolinite with either illite or smectite, a nearly linear relationship was observed. For example, a mix with a mass percent 50% kaolinite and 50% illite had a liquid limit halfway between the liquid limits of each individual clay. 
Mixtures of smectite with illite did not adhere to a simple linear relationship. The LL of the mixtures were always lower than would be predicted. Small additions of illite to montmorillonite lowered the LL by more than expected, and small additions of smectite to illite raised the LL by less than would be expected. The response of the plastic limit to smectite additions were more complex. With small bentonite additions, the plastic limit was lower than expected, while for larger bentonite additions the PL was higher than expected. 
Seed et al. noted that if a mass-weighted value of Skempton activity was used instead of pure mass percent, ????

@Sivapullaiah showed that their linear law was not valid for mixtures of bentonite with kaolinite. The liquid limit of the mixture was always lower than would be expected from the linear law. This implies an interaction between the clay mineral particles.

Data pertaining to sand-clay mixes only have tested sand with particle sieve diameters of < 425 μm
The transitional fines content of sand mixed with plastic fines has scarcely been explored 
The effect of silt-to-clay ratio has been championed yet without systematic evaluation for the same type of extant clay minerals.
Quantitative analysis has not been applied to the toughness of clays, save for the studies of Barnes who used acyclic shearing mode similar to that of the standard hand-rolling plastic limit test. In addition, the range of acceptable strain values for a given engineering problem significantly changes the toughness computation. For highly ductile materials, the failure strain is extremely high, and an unacceptably large deformation may be incurred before a failure criterion is reached. In the standard unconfined compression test, the test is halted at 20% strain if a clear peak has not been reached. Toughness is computed as the integral of the stress strain curve from zero strain all the way up to the failure strain. In contrast, Barnes elected to define the toughness of clays as a definite integral from the soil thread diameter of 6 mm down to 4 mm, because in this region deformation of the soil thread was considered to be relatively stable and the stress-strain curves extend with only slight curvature. However this approach may underestimate the toughness of more brittle specimens because the energy dissipated at low strain but high stress is not included in the calculation. It is evident that the strain range chosen for the toughness calculation can substantially change the conclusions about toughness, and one must select the failure criterion carefully based on the problem of interest.
