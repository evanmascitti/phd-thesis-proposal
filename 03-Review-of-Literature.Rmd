Baseball fields are built from soil. 
Therefore, soil behavior determines the safety and function of the field. 
The purpose of this dissertation is to assess and improve the behavior of soil mixtures used on baseball infields. 

This project draws on concepts from a number of scientific fields.
In this literature review I focus on three areas:

**Section \@ref(infield-performance)** [Surface performance of baseball/softball infields](#infield-performance)

**Section \@ref(lab-methods-review)** [Laboratory tests for soil behavior and physical properties](#lab-methods-review)

**Section \@ref(artificial-soil-mixtures)** [Design and behavior of artificial soil mixtures](#artificial-soil-mixtures)

These sections reflect the goals of my thesis (Section \@ref(purpose-and-objectives)): identifying the technical aspects of a practical problem, pairing them with an appropriate lab test, and applying lab tests to solve the practical problem.

## Performance of baseball infield surfaces {#infield-performance} 

Baseball and softball players engage with the playing surface in two ways: directly (by running, pivoting, and sliding) and indirectly (by fielding batted balls).
Footing and ball response are the main surface properties of interest.
<!-- to the athlete and the grounds manager. -->
Published research on baseball infields is relatively scant. Studies relevant to footing and ball response are summarized below.

### Footing 

#### Traction

Traction allows the athlete to run, change directions, and perform other maneuvers without slipping, sliding, or otherwise losing control. 
Traction is distinct from planar friction because of the presence of studs or other gripping aids on the players' footwear [@McNitt1997a]. 
Even when using machine tests (rather than human subjects), measuring traction is complicated by non-linear interactions between surface type, shoe type, and loading weights [@Nigg1990]. 
Excessive rotational traction is associated with lower extremity injuries, but traction differences among shoe types are often larger than those across surface types [@Serensits2014]. 
Clear-cut thresholds separating acceptable and unaccpetable traction have not been established.

Most athletic field research has focused on natural grass and synthetic turf. 
There are two published accounts of traction measurements on infield skin surfaces. 

@Goodall2005 measured traction on plots constructed from 5 different soils blended with 4 rates of calcined clay. 
Higher traction levels were reported for silty and loamy soils than for sandier soils. 
Mixing the soil with calcined clay prior to plot construction had no effect on traction. 
No relationship was found between traction and water content, although only 3 water contents were tested.

@Brosnan2011 measured traction on research plots of the same infield soil subjected to various treatments. 
Traction was increased by soil compaction and decreased by surficial additions of calcined clay. 


#### The "corkboard effect"

The nature of cleat indentations could be considered an element of footing. 
However, this topic has not been studied in scientific experiments and no primary literature is available. 
A description has been provided in the problem description portion of this proposal (Section \@ref(problem-description)). 
@Zwaska1999 also described the corkboard concept and other desirable properties of the infield skin.   



### Ball response {#ball-response-lit-review}

The reaction of a baseball upon contact with the surface plays a key role in the outcome of competition (recall Figures \@ref(fig:batted-ball-density) and \@ref(fig:corkboard-concept)). 
As with footing, limited research is available on infield ball response. 

@Goodall2005 is the only published account of controlled research on multiple infield soils. 
The authors installed 5 soils which were commercially available within the northeastern United States. 
Static and dynamic ball friction were measured along with traction and other soil properties. 
The authors found that increases in water content raised the coefficients of static and dynamic friction between the ball and the soil surface. 
The increase was likely due to greater ball penetration, increasing the contact area between the ball and the surface and also prolonging their interaction. 
@Goodall2005 suggested that surface pace may be more related to friction than to hardness. 
This agrees with intuition because the main component of a ground ball's velocity is horizontal (nearly coplanar with the surface), favoring the importance of horizontal friction rather than vertical rebound. 
Incorporation of calcined clay (particle size 0.5 - 2 mm) also decreased friction, especially for finer-textured soils.

@Brosnan2011 studied the effects of construction and maintenance activities on infield surface pace.
Water content was negatively correlated with surface pace, but no attempt was made to intentionally alter water content across plots. 
Higher bulk density ($\rho_{bulk}$) increased surface pace. 
However, Figure \@ref(fig:lit-review-density-comparison) shows that the density values reported by @Goodall2005 and @Brosnan2011 may not be representative of professionally-managed infield skins. 
@Brosnan2011 also found that topdressing plots with calcined clay had no effect on pace, nor did scarifying the surface by up to 2 cm.

```


The effect of ball spin may be large or small depending on the the ball-surface friction coefficient [@Daish1972; @Cross2019].
Low friction cases the ball to skid through impact and retain some of its original spin.
Higher friction allows the ball to "grip" the surface and roll through impact. 
Skilled cricket bowlers readily exploit this property on a moist wicket to redirect the ball [@Daish1972].
In the high-friction case, initial spin is fully attenuated after impact and the new spin rate is controlled by the ball's original velocity and the friction coefficient.
The release angle will be more affected by a high-friction surface (Figure \@ref(fig:daish-spin-release-angle)).


When soil stiffness is low, the ball produces a notable indentation of the surface (Figure \@ref(fig:ball-indentation-release-angle)).
An important consequence of the larger deformation is that the contact area between the ball and the surface is increased. 
This prolongs the impact duration and allows friction more time to attenuate spin and forward velocity [@Daish1972]. 
As the ball releases, it rolls up the saucer-like depression created by its own impact at a slightly steeper angle compared to a rigid surface (Figure \@ref(fig:ball-indentation-release-angle)). 
A moderate indentation may be the critical feature linking hardness, bounce, pace, and spin.

Infield skins bear many similarities to cricket pitches, which have been researched more extensively. 
Ball response is influenced by soil bulk density, clay content, water content, organic matter, and particle size distribution [@Baker2006].

@Adams2001a completed a laboratory study on surface friction of cricket soils. 
This experiment mixed the same clayey soil with 6 types of coarse amendments. 
All final mixes had sand content between 30 and 40% by mass. 
Ball-to-surface friction was highest for the mix containing sand between 125 and 60 &mu;m sieve diameter. 
Lower friction was measured for soils with coarser or finer amendments. 
Using a suede-type leather increased friction relative to polished leather, implying that the degree of wear on the ball may influence surface pace.

### Summary: performance of infield skin soils 

Stable footing and predictable ball response comprise the requirements of an infield skin. 
Soil composition, bulk density, and water content act together to govern the stiffness and plasticity of the surface. 
Surface deformation attenuates linear and rotational kinetic energy of the ball.
The few existing studies on infield skin soils have focused on construction and maintenance rather than mix design.

## Laboratory tests for soil behavior and physical properties {#lab-methods-review} 

The goal of laboratory soil testing is to assess or predict the properties of a soil in the field. 
Many laboratory soil tests are time-intensive and costly. 
Results from simpler tests are commonly used as surrogate markers for the information yielded by more intensive testing. 
The methodology underlying these "surrogate" tests has been studied extensively because much is riding on their precision and accuracy. 

This sub-section reviews literature on the laboratory tests most pertinent to infield soils.
The first two portions briefly cover soil water content and particle size analysis.
The latter two portions provide a more extensive treatment of two test categories most relevant to infield soils: plasticity tests and toughness tests.


### Soil water content {#soil-water-content}

Agronomists, engineers and pedologists all consider soil water content an important concept. 
Soil water has been studied extensively using a variety of methods. 
This brief section does not attempt to review the overwhelming body of literature on soil water.
It simply defines the main connotations in which the term "water content" is used; these will be referenced repeatedly throughout this proposal. 

Soil water content has two basic definitions: 

(1.) Gravimetric ($w$): mass of water referenced to oven-dry mass of soil:^[the mass of water is referenced to _moist_ soil in some fields including pottery and coal geoscience. This approach is not widely favored because the denominator changes as a function of the measurement value, so there is no absolute reference.]

\begin{equation}
w = \frac{m_{water}}{m_{soil~solids}}
(\#eq:gravimetric-water-content)
\end{equation}

(2.) Volumetric ($\theta$): volume of water referenced to total bulk soil volume:

\begin{equation}
\theta = \frac{V_{water}}{V_{soil~solids}+V_{voids}}
(\#eq:volumetric-water-content)
\end{equation}

$\theta$ is readily computed from phase relations if both $w$ and $\rho_{bulk}$ are known:

\begin{equation}
\theta=w~\cdot~\rho_{bulk}
(\#eq:theta-from-rho-and-w)
\end{equation}

Volumetric water content $\theta$ is commonly estimated in-situ with indirect techniques such as neutron scattering or time-domain reflectometry [@Brady2007].

Both $w$ and $\theta$ are used across disciplines. 
Each has merits and disadvantages.
$w$ is easiest to measure: it only requires a drying oven and an accurate balance. 
$w$ is more concretely anchored because the denominator never changes, no matter how wet the soil becomes. 
This is not the case for $\theta$. 

<!-- Once all the pores become filled with water, the bulk soil volume will increase if the soil cannot drain freely. -->

$\theta$ has a more intuitive physical meaning for unsaturated, dimensionally-stable soils (Figure (\@ref(fig:example-phase-diagram)).
It is the volume rather than mass of water which governs the contacts among particles. 
$\theta$ is more useful for irrigation and water flux calculations.

As a broad generalization, $w$ is favored by engineers and $\theta$ is favored by agronomists and soil physicists.

### Particle size analysis

Soils consist of solid particles of different of sizes. 
Particle size analysis (PSA) refers to the large suite of techniques use to measure these particles' dimensions. 
PSA is inexpensive and relatively fast compared to other analyses.
It has been used as a surrogate marker for some other soil property in nearly every sub-discipline of soil science. 
Unfortunately the results of a PSA are highly dependent on the method employed, and there is no universally-accepted protocol [@Gee2002].

PSA has formed the basis for most discussions about infield mix [@Schroder2009; @Schroder2012]. 
Current recommendations for infield mixes revolve around total sand content and silt-to-clay ratio (SCR) [@ASTMF2107-08]. 
There are two potential problems with using PSA as a specification for infield soils:

1. Obtaining accurate PSA data is challenging.
1. The linkage between PSA and the behavior of fine-grained soils can be spurious. 

When I began this project, I conducted an an extensive review of PSA literature.
I chose not to include it in this proposal because PSA is not the focus of my dissertation. 
This document is already very long and I felt that a long discussion of PSA methods would divert the reader's focus away from more central themes of the project. 

This section briefly outlines some possible pitfalls of using PSA for characterizing infield soils. 
Rather than recount the minutiae of particular studies, I focus on the positions held by governing bodies and the views of historically significant soil scientists.  


#### Ambiguity of PSA methods

There is no universally agreed-upon method for performing a PSA. Many samples require special treatment, making comparison of results difficult.

Authors rarely report the full protocol used to obtain their PSA results. 
Indeed, the vast array of pre-treatment, dispersion, and measurement techniques mean that comparing PSA results across studies often proves difficult or impossible. 

Even when protocols are clearly reported, we are confronted with a difficult dilemma: if carbonates, iron oxides, and organic matter are all destroyed, what exactly is the physical meaning of the test result? These components surely contribute to the soil's properties in its "natural" state. 

<!-- While correct, this sentence is weak and I like the tone that the prior praph ends with, so I'm commenting it out. There is also evidence that some dispersion techniques break individual mineral particles into smaller fragments, further confounding the analysis. -->


ASTM D-7928 [-@ASTMD79282017] outlines the set of protocols in use by most U.S. labs. D-7928 gives a clear disclaimer about the variability of natural soils and the need for context-specific methods:

>"Some types of soil require special treatment in order to correctly determine the particle sizes...these treatments, however, add significant time and effort when performing the sedimentation test and are allowable but outside the scope of this test method."

In particular, the measurement of clay-size particles is highly subject to differences in techniques. 
@Gee2002 is considered an authoritative text on PSA methods. These authors noted the large potential variation in clay-size content (emphasis mine):

>Depending on the method of chemical treatment and physical dispersion used, measured clay content for an individual soil sample \textbf{can vary by factors of four or more}.

The above statements imply that a given infield mix could easily pass a PSA specification when tested with one method, but fail when tested with another - even when flawlessly tested in the same lab, by the same operator.
A system which relies entirely on un-standardized methods cannot provide an adequate means of assessment.


#### Relationship between PSA and soil behavior 

There can be wide disparities in the behavior of two soils having similar textural classifications.
The behavior of fine-grained soil is governed not only by its particles' size but also by their surface charge and shape.
This was recognized by many pioneers of modern soil science and geotechnical engineering. 
A few quotations from the literature are instructive.

- @Casagrande1947 compared agricultural soil classification systems (based on grain size) with the Airfield classification he developed during World War II. He pointed out the main pitfall of a textural classification system:

>"Engineers who have used [the textural triangle] have often noticed serious discrepancies between the names as derived from the triangle and the actual physical characteristics of the soils." 

- @Terzaghi1996 discussed the importance of choosing the correct soil tests for site characterization: 

>“Any classification system based on grain size alone is likely to be misleading, because the physical properties of the finest soil fractions depend on many factors other than grain size.” 

- Work by A. Atterberg formed the basis of _both_ the International grain-size system and the plasticity-based systems used by engineers [@Simonson1999]. @Blackall1952 described Atterberg's view on this topic:

>“[Atterberg] decided...that very often the mechanical composition obtained from settling analysis did not express the physical properties of the soil. So he set out to determine the physical properties peculiar to the different soil types, and found plasticity to be particularly characteristic of clay.”



#### Summary: particle size analysis 

PSA is a useful starting point in predicting a soil's physical properties and how it will interact with water. 
This forms the basis for the USDA textural triangle.
Unfortunately, PSA is difficult to measure consistently across labs. It seems unlikely that a single, universal method will ever be adopted.
In addition, PSA does not always predict how a soil will respond to changes in water content. 
This is the most important trait of an infield soil.
Therefore, there are serious doubts about the validity of PSA as an all-telling means of infield soil analysis.
Developing an infield soils framework better grounded in actual soil behavior is the primary motivator of this dissertation.

### Plasticity tests {#plasticity-tests}

The behavior of a fine-grained soil is markedly affected by its water content [@Holtz2010]. Soil plasticity tests measure the unique water contents corresponding to shared behavioral thresholds.  This section reviews the tests' history, methodology, and potential shortcomings.

#### Origins of plasticity tests {#atterberg-limits-origins}

The earliest test methods for soil plasticity were developed by Atterberg [-@Atterberg1911; -@Atterberg1974].
Plasticity^[from the Greek _plastikos_, "to mold or form"] is the tendency of a material to deform under an applied load, without fracturing into multiple pieces, and to retain its new shape when the load is removed [@Andrade2011].


Atterberg noted that plasticity is easy to observe but does not lend itself to simple measurement.
He showed that soil was plastic only within a finite range of water content which differed for every soil.
He termed the upper boundary the "flow limit," at which two batches of soil paste flowed together when jarred. 
He defined the lower boundary as the "rolling limit," when the soil had dried enough to become brittle and could no longer be rolled into thin threads. 
The difference between the flow limit and the rolling limit was the “plasticity number." 
Today these are known as the liquid limit, plastic limit, and plasticity index. 
He defined 3 additional consistency limits, though none are widely used today. These included:

- **Upper limit of viscous flow**: soil flows easily, similar to water
- **Adhesion limit**: soil no longer adheres to a metal implement
- **Cohesion limit**: lumps of soil can be no longer pressed together with one's fingers

Atterberg concluded that his plasticity number was the most reliable means of measuring plasticity but pointed out that it gave no information about the effort required to deform the soil.
He considered the effort needed to remold the soil a separate property, which translates to English as "viscosity." This distinction will be considered further in Section \@ref(soil-toughness), on soil toughness.

Atterberg’s work has never been fully appreciated in his own discipline of agricultural soil science. His test methods were adopted and standardized by geotechnical engineers [@Terzaghi1926; @Casagrande1932].
@Terzaghi1926 acknowledged the arbitrary nature of the tests but emphasized their importance for preliminary soil investigations. 
He pointed out that the tests' value lies in quantifying an otherwise subjective phenomenon:

> “Every engineer should develop the habit of expressing the plasticity and grain-size characteristics of soils by numerical values rather than adjectives…..the degree of plasticity should be indicated by the estimated value of the plasticity index and not by the words ‘trace of plasticity’ or ‘highly plastic.’ ” <br> \- @Terzaghi1996


A variety of other methods have been employed to measure the plasticity of clays.
These include torque rheometers, extruders, and compression devices [@Andrade2011].
The remainder of this section focuses on the Atterberg tests and their derivatives because the other methods are scarcely used in soil science. 

#### Modern protocols for Atterberg limits 

Standard test methods typically pair the plastic and liquid limit tests. 
In the United States the relevant standards are @ASTMD43182018 and @AASHTO2020 while @BS13771990 is typically cited in Europe. 
The United States methods use the Casagrande cup to determine the liquid limit while the British method uses a fall-cone device; these are briefly described in the next sub-section and compared further in Section \@ref(atterberg-limits-reproducibility-and-repeatability).
The plastic limit tests described in the three standards are essentially identical.
Note that in Atterberg limit tests the term **water content** is always used on a gravimetric basis ($w$, see Equation \@ref(eq:gravimetric-water-content)).


##### Liquid limit {#liquid-limit-devices}

The "flow limit" test described by @Atterberg1911 lacked reproducibility because it required the operator to manually agitate the soil. 
A mechanical test method was first presented by @Casagrande1932 and the method has undergone little alteration up to the present. 
The Casagrande apparatus comprises a brass cup fixed to a rotating cam. 
A groove is cut in the soil paste. 
The soil paste is agitated by dropping the cup against a hard rubber base until the soil begins to flow and the groove closes over a span of 13 mm (1/2 in) (Figure \@ref(fig:ll-test-procedure) A).
Casagrande arbitrarily defined the liquid limit as the water content needed to close the groove after 25 blows. 
Several trials are made and the water content is plotted against the natural logarithm of blow count (Figure \@ref(fig:ll-test-procedure) B). 
The water content to produce 25 blows is interpolated from this regression.

```{r ll-test-procedure, fig.cap='\\textbf{A.} Casagrande cup with specimen at failure condition. \\textbf{B.} Example flow curve for interpolating $w_{LL}$ at 25 blows.', fig.scap='Liquid limit test procedure with Casagrande cup'}

knitr::include_graphics('./figs/png/example-LL-combined-panels.png')

```


Several fall-cone methods have been proposed for determining the liquid limit.^[These methods are purportedly traceable to the Russian researcher Piotr Vasilje [@wikipediafallcone2021], although the author has been unable to verify this claim in primary literature because Vasilje's work has not been translated to English.] 
The fall-cone methods offer several advantages over the Casagrande method and have been widely adopted internationally. 
Merits of the fall-cone methods include:

1. Less operator dependency [@Sherwood1970a]
2. Provide a more straightforward estimate of the soil's undrained shear strength [@Haigh2016]
3. Ability to determine the liquid limit for some low-plasticity soils which cannot be tested with the Casagrande cup [@Sherwood1970a; @Sivapullaiah1985]

The British Standard is the most widely-used fall-cone method and considers the liquid limit as the water content at which an 80 g cone with a single-sided angle of 30&deg; penetrates the sample to a depth of 20 mm [@BS13771990].
Unfortunately, other nations have developed similar methods with different cone masses and angles so comparing results is challenging. 
Empirical correlations have been established to convert between the Casagrande LL and the fall-cone LL. 
For soils with LL <100, the two methods give good agreement but for soils with LL>100 the cone yields lower values [@Holtz2010; @OKelly2017]. 

##### Plastic limit

Atterberg's original plastic limit test remains essentially unchanged. 
After performing the liquid limit test, a ~5 g sample of soil is gradually dried by gentle blow drying and re-molding. 
Once the soil can be molded without sticking to the operator’s skin, the soil is rolled into a thread of 3.2 mm diameter, broken apart, and pressed into a new lump (Figure \@ref(fig:pl-test-procedure) A). 
This process is repeated until the soil crumbles when the rolling action is applied (Figure \@ref(fig:pl-test-procedure) B). 
The plastic limit is the water content at which the soil can no longer be rolled out.

```{r pl-test-procedure, fig.cap='\\textbf{A.} Soil thread just above the plastic limit. \\textbf{B.} The same soil at its plastic limit.', fig.scap='Soil threads above and at the plastic limit.'}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/png/example-pl-threads-panels.png')
```

@Terzaghi1926 introduced the use of a fixed thread diameter of 1/8" (3.2 mm), although its significance has been recently questioned  by @Barnes2013. 
The stability of the soil thread is related to the maximum particle diameter and the rolling technique. 
@Barnes2013 argued that emphasis should be shifted away from a specific thread diameter and toward observation of the thread during the test. 


#### Uncertainty associated with Atterberg limits {#atterberg-limits-errors}

Atterberg limit tests can be performed rapidly and require only simple equipment and few consumables. 
They also correlate reasonably well with other soil properties such as shear strength, compressibility, and permeability. 
Unfortunately there are multiple sources of error associated with the tests and these are often raised as critiques of their utility.
Sections \@ref(atterberg-limits-reproducibility-and-repeatability)-\@ref(plastic-limit-test-improvement-attempts) outline research on the tests' error sources and attempts to improve them. 

##### Repeatability and reproducibility {#atterberg-limits-reproducibility-and-repeatability}

Repeatability is the similarity of results obtained via multiple trials of the same test, on the same sample, by the same operator.
Reproducibility is the similarity of results for the same sample by different test operators or different labs [@Ullman2009]. 


@Sherwood1970 conducted an extensive investigation on the repeatability and reproducibility of several common laboratory tests. 
Three soils termed B, G, and W were pulverized and riffled repeatedly to ensure their homogeneity. The samples were sent to 41 laboratories which performed several tests on them, including the Atterberg limits. 
The tests were replicated by multiple operators at the Road Research Laboratory (RRL) and also by a single expert RRL operator.
The goal was to compare the variability across each means of replication. 


```{r produce plots and values from Sherwood 1970}
source("supplemental_R_scripts/Sherwood_1970_plots_facet_style.R")
```


Results differed widely across laboratories, but agreement was much better for operators trained in the same lab and better still for repeated tests by the same operator. 
Figure \@ref(fig:sherwood-overall-comparison) shows that extreme values for the liquid limit differed across labs by as much as `r max(sherwood_across_labs_ranges$LL_range)` units. 
Plastic limit values varied by up to `r max(sherwood_across_labs_ranges$PL_range)` units (30-40% of their mean values). 
Figure \@ref(fig:sherwood-overall-comparison) also shows variation across eight individuals employed by the Road Research Laboratory at the time of the study. 
These technicians were considered highly experienced and the spread of their results was much smaller than that across laboratories. 
Repeatability was better still for a single operator; all six results are tightly clustered around their mean with maximum deviations of `r max(sherwood_single_operator_ranges$LL)` units for the liquid limit and `r max(sherwood_single_operator_ranges$PL)` units for the plastic limit. 


```{r sherwood-overall-comparison, fig.height=9, fig.cap='Reproducibility is excellent for a single operator, fair among operators in the same lab, and relatively poor across laboratories.', fig.scap='Repeatability and reproducibility of Atterberg limit tests'}
att_lims_variation_plot

```

The spread of data points in Figure \@ref(fig:sherwood-overall-comparison) could be viewed as misleading because the number of replicates was fewer for the within-lab and within-operator studies than the inter-lab study. 
Therefore it is useful to compare the coefficients of variation (COV) for the three studies. Figure \@ref(fig:sherwood-cov-comparison) shows that the smaller range of results for a single lab or single operator is truly due to better precision and not to fewer samples being tested. Compared to the inter-lab study, the plastic limit COV for one operator's replicates are smaller by a factor of `r pl_single_operator_vs_multiple_labs_cov_factor` and the COV for the 8 RRL operators was smaller by a factor of `r pl_multiple_operators_vs_multiple_labs_cov_factor`.
The coefficient of variation was remarkably consistent across soils: across the 41 labs, the three materials had COV values of `r  summary_covs_across_labs$LL_cov[1]`, `r  summary_covs_across_labs$LL_cov[2]`, and `r  summary_covs_across_labs$LL_cov[3]`% for the liquid limit and `r  summary_covs_across_labs$PL_cov[1]`, `r  summary_covs_across_labs$PL_cov[2]`, and `r  summary_covs_across_labs$PL_cov[3]`% for the plastic limit. 
Evidently, the uncertainty associated with a single test result is not a function of soil type. 


The liquid limit involves a mechanical device whereas the plastic limit test introduces a greater degree of operator judgment. 
One could expect better agreement for the liquid limit and this is clearly borne out by each pair of bars in Figure \@ref(fig:sherwood-cov-comparison).

A separate study by @Sherwood1970a showed that the fall-cone method has better inter-operator reproducibility than the Casagrande cup. Figure \@ref(fig:sherwood-cone-cup-comparison) shows the spread of the 6 replicated tests for each method. The coefficient of variation among operators was about half that of the Casagrande method. 

Wide variability across labs was not limited to Atterberg limit tests. 
@Sherwood1970 performed similar analyses for three other tests (Proctor compaction, hydrometer analysis, and specific gravity).
His own assessment of the study was less than optimistic:

>"The results of this investigation....are for the most part rather disturbing, since it is clear that none of [the tests] can be used without quite wide tolerances being placed on the values obtained."

##### Sources of error in Atterberg limit methods {#atterberg-limits-error-sources}

Section \@ref(atterberg-limits-reproducibility-and-repeatability) described the expected uncertainties associated with Atterberg limit results. 
@Sherwood1970 showed that most soil physical tests -- not just Atterberg limits -- are repeatable only when performed by qualified operators using a well-tuned apparatus and careful workmanship.

It is next useful to explore the sources of these errors so they can be minimized. Four chief sources of laboratory error for the Atterberg limits include:

1. specimen preparation
1. function/calibration of test apparatus
1. operator technique
1. water content determination

Each is outlined in the following sections. 

Note that these do not include sampling practices, which are carried out prior to laboratory testing and normally comprise a larger source of error than any laboratory procedure [@Brady2007]. 

##### Specimen preparation
The means by which a soil specimen is mixed and handled can affect the results obtained from physical tests.     

@Howell1997 performed compaction tests on sand-bentonite mixtures produced with different preparation methods. 
They showed that a longer "curing" time after adding water slightly increased the optimum water content for compaction $w_{opt}$. 
The effect was small; $\Delta~w_{opt}$ was only ~ 0.5% when using granular/pelletized bentonite and not detectable for powdered bentonite. 
The effect of mixing procedure was more apparent. 
Mixing water with the sand prior to adding the bentonite increased $w_{opt}$ by up to 0.02 compared with mixing the soil components dry and adding the water last. $\rho_{max}$ was also lower when the water was added before the bentonite. 
Evidently, the water was more apt to associate with the sand in the latter procedure. 
It seems likely this effect would extend to Atterberg limit tests on sand-clay mixtures. 

@Armstrong1986 tested 13 means of preparing soil specimens for Atterberg limit tests. 
They reported a 4 % water content decrease in the liquid limit due to oven-drying at either 60 or 110&deg; C. 
This was attributed to incomplete re-hydration of the clay mineral surfaces and micropores. 
If the soil was oven-dried, the liquid limit was increased by curing the sample for 24 hours after adding water. 
Another marginal LL increase was noted for a 48-hour cure time. 
The relevant finding is that soil specimens should never be oven-dried prior to testing. If they are air-dry, they should be thoroughly cured with water before beginning the test. 
@ASTMD43182018 prohibits drying above 60&deg; C and requires a minimum 16-hour curing time. 

@Dumbleton1966a tested the effect of mixing duration on Atterberg limits of several soils. 
The liquid limit for some soils continually increased with additional mixing.
The LL of soils containing iron oxide cements increased continually for up to 3 hours of mixing.
Apparently the cements were degraded by the extra agitation, because non-cemented London clay showed no change after additional mixing. 
No information was provided about the actual mixing procedure, though one could assume it was performed by hand with a spatula or similar tool. 



##### Apparatus-related errors

@Casagrande1958 expressed regret that his original design did not quantitatively specify the rubber base's properties. 
The loose specification led to disparities among the devices produced by various manufacturers, and these devices yielded different liquid limits despite being otherwise identical. 

@Sherwood1970 concluded that so long as a standard test device is used, differences in operator technique comprise a larger source of error than the device itself.
However, a recent survey by @Haigh2016 confirmed that the hardness and resilience of the rubber base does vary widely across national specifications. 
Even within a rubber type (hard or soft), the coefficient of variation in rubber hardness was around 20%. 
Analytical solutions by @Haigh2016 predict that a 20% deviation in base stiffness yields a change in the liquid limit of 2-3% of its value (i.e. coefficient of variation). 
This variability is similar to the standard deviation reported by an ASTM reproducibility study across 14 labs [@ASTMD43182018]. @Haigh2016 suggested that a large fraction of inter-laboratory variability could be due simply to variation in the rubber base properties of the devices employed. 

Assuming the device meets specification, the most common error sources with the Casagrande apparatus are a worn grooving tool and variability in in drop height caused by a loose locking screw [@Sherwood1970]. 
The drop height must be frequently calibrated to ensure accurate results [@ASTMD43182018].


##### Operator technique errors: liquid limit 

The means by which the groove is cut and the rate at which the cam is agitated will affect the flow of the soil. 
Every effort must be made to maintain the tool in an orthogonal position to the cup surface throughout the action [@Casagrande1958]. 
Cutting a uniform grove can be especially challenging for soils containing sand [@Sherwood1970a]; the larger sand particles tend to be torn from the groove's sides, making it wider and more ragged. 
The cam should be agitated at a constant rate of 2 blows per second [@ASTMD43182018].
Inadequate mixing of the specimen can also contribute to erroneous blow counts and water content determinations. 

##### Operator technique errors: plastic limit

Sources of error include the operator's rolling path, judgment of the crumbling condition, and weighing errors in the water content determination. 

#### Water content determination 

The LL and PL methods depend heavily on an accurate determination of the water content. 
The water content determination may comprise a substantial source of error during the tests, but this uncertainty source receives less attention than the test mechanics.
Clean workmanship is essential to avoid flakes of dry soil contaminating the fresh specimen [@Barnes2013]. 
The laboratory balance in use must be of sufficient sensitivity and frequently calibrated.

```


Figure \@ref(fig:LL-w-determination-variability) shows the water contents of 10 replicate determinations from the same soil specimen near its LL (data collected by the author).
Each point represents the water content determined from a ~5 g sample from the same bowl of (ostensibly) homogenous soil.

The samples were taken in rapid succession and could be considered identical "technical replications."
Figure \@ref(fig:LL-w-determination-variability)  indicates that even with the use of a milligram balance, one should expect a standard deviation of $w$~ `r LL_sd` when sampled from a well-mixed specimen.


#### Attempts to improve plastic limit test {#plastic-limit-test-improvement-attempts}

Most attempts to improve the plastic limit test have focused on mechanizing the thread-rolling procedure in hopes of improving its reproducibility across operators.
Test operators utilize different combinations of force, speed, and displacement when rolling the soil. Collectively these variables were termed "rolling path" by [@Barnes2013]. 
@Bobrowski1992 described a simple apparatus to aid the operator in producing a thread of precisely 3.2 mm. 
The device consists of a flat plexiglass plate which is used to roll the thread, instead of the operator's hand. @Bobrowski1992 also stated that paper should be affixed to the base of the device to prevent the thread from sliding and to expedite the drying process. 
Use of this device is allowed, but not mandated, in the current version of ASTM D4318. 
The Bobrowski-Griekspoor device was criticized by @Barnes2013, who cited the data of @Rashid2008 to assert that the rolling device produces excessively rapid drying and eliminates the soil thread from the view of the operator. 

A fully mechanized thread rolling apparatus was developed by @Temyingyong2002. Their device used two acrylic plates similar to @Bobrowski1992 and added a DC motor to apply the rolling action. 
The DC voltage was adjusted to control the rolling speed, and the downward force was altered by the addition of weights to the upper plate. 

@Temyingyong2002 found that the initial diameter of the soil mass explained a larger amount of variation in the test result than did factors which might be ascribed to the subjective manual method (speed and pressure). 
The device still appears to be a significant improvement over the hand-rolling method; unfortunately, the device is not commercially available and its use has not been adopted by governing bodies. 


@Barnes2009 introduced a novel thread-rolling apparatus which allows precise control of the load applied to the soil thread (\@ref(fig:barnes-apparatus)). 
The device comprises two stainless steel plates: a fixed base and an upper loading plate which is manually oscillated. 
The load is adjusted by sliding a weight ballast along the side of the device opposite the handle. 
The further the ballast weight is from a pivot point, the lesser the load on the soil thread. The device is still operated by hand and a constant rate of rolling must be maintained through careful operation. 
A thin smear of petrolatum is used on the stainless steel plates to encourage extrusion of the soil thread. 
A number of other useful properties have been developed with this device, as described in the section of this review on soil toughness (Section \@ref(soil-toughness)).

```{r barnes-apparatus, fig.cap='Barnes apparatus used for determining plastic limit and soil toughness (Barnes, 2013)', fig.scap='Barnes apparatus for determining plastic limit and soil toughness.'}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/barnes-apparatus.png')
```


@Moreno-Maroto2015a described a plastic limit test in which a soil thread is bent rather than rolled (Figure \@ref(fig:moreno-marato-thread-bending-procedure)). 
The soil is wetted to a moldable consistency and flattened to ~3 mm. 
A special slicing tool is used to create a rectangular prism of soil having precise dimensions of 3 mm x 3 mm x 50 mm. 
The specimen is then rounded into a cylindrical thread using the same tool. 
The thread is carefully bent about its center, which is anchored around a stainless steel cylinder. When the thread begins to crack, a caliper is used to measure the distance between the two ends of the thread. 
The test is repeated for at least two other water contents and the water content of the threads is plotted against the displacement with segmented regression. 
The steeper segment is extrapolated to zero displacement and this water content is taken as the plastic limit. 

```{r moreno-marato-thread-bending-procedure, fig.cap='Thread-bending test described by Moreno-Maroto and Alonso-Azcárate (2015)', fig.scap='Thread-bending test (Moreno-Maroto and Alonso-Azcárate, 2015)', fig.pos='htbp'}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/moreno-marato-bending-limit-procedure.png')
```

@Moreno-Maroto2017 also described a faster version of their original thread-bending test. 
In this version only a single thread is prepared and its displacement and water content are extrapolated to zero displacement using an empirical equation. 
The authors argued that their test meets the original requirements of any plastic limit test which could replace the current method, namely: (1) rapid (2) repeatable, and (3) operator-independent.


#### Summary: Plastiticy tests 

The Atterberg limit tests have changed little since their adoption in the early 20th century. 
The tests are quick to perform and correlate reasonably well with other soil behavior parameters. 
Chief sources of error include specimen preparation and operator technique. 
Smaller sources include apparatus-related and weighing errors. 
As for PSA, inter-laboratory reproducibility is relatively poor.
Unlike PSA, plasticity tests directly tie the soil's behavior to its water content. 

Many attempts have been made to improve or supplant the canonical Atterberg methods.
In the author's view, the original tests are unlikely to be abandoned because of their simplicity and the abundance of data which has accumulated from their use.


### Toughness tests {#soil-toughness}

Toughness is a conspicuous feature of clay soils. It plays an important role on the infield skin because the soil must be both stiff and ductile to achieve the corkboard effect (Section \@ref(corkboard-effect-section)). 
This section describes the nature of toughness and research which has measured or modeled it for clay soils.

#### Definitions of toughness {#toughness-definitions}


In mechanics, toughness is the total effort or work required to deform a specimen to its failure condition. 
It is mathematically defined as the area beneath a stress-strain curve up to failure.
This integral is traditionally computed over the entire material test, but the strain range may be arbitrarily defined for a specific problem [@Barnes2013; @Barnes2013b].
Toughness is a measure of work and it bears units of energy per unit volume (J m^-3^) [@Mamlouk2006]. 


A large peak strength does not necessarily imply a material is tough. 
A brittle material may have a high strength but low toughness if it fails at low strain. 
Conversely, a ductile material which deforms to very high strain levels may be quite tough despite its low ultimate strength [@Mamlouk2006]. 


Most research on soil behavior is concerned with stress and strain at failure. Less attention has been given to energy dissipation at sub-failure strain levels.
A baseball field differs from most engineering applications because a small amount of deformation to the soil is actually desirable (Section \@ref(corkboard-effect-section)). 


Toughness of fine-grained soils varies widely.
This observation is well-understood by people who work intimately with clay in trades such as pottery-making or earthworks. 
Atterberg himself noted that the "plasticity number" did not provide information on the toughness of the soil (Section \@ref(atterberg-limits-origins)).
Similarly, @Casagrande1932 noted:

>“There is a wide variation in the shearing resistance of different soils at the plastic limit. This difference may be felt by hand when performing the plastic limit test on various soils....the toughness of a clay at its plastic limit may therefore be described as the maximum stiffness or shearing resistance which it can acquire without losing its plasticity.”

Note that this description is more qualitative and differs slightly from that given by @Mamlouk2006.

The plastic limit is not a test of shear strength or toughness. It merely reflects the water content at which a drying soil becomes brittle. 
Regrettably, the distinctions among plasticity, strength, and toughness have been blurred by authors who report the plastic limit as a water content corresponding to a particular value of cone penetration (for example, @Whyte1982). 
Reported values of peak strength at the plastic limit differ by up to 2 orders of magnitude [@Haigh2013]. 
There is no unique shear strength at the plastic limit.

@Barnes2009 presented an apparatus which measures soil toughness directly.
This apparatus was described in Section \@ref(plastic-limit-test-improvement-attempts). 
Barnes later published a series of papers on the toughness of clays in their pure state, admixed with sand or silt, or blended with other clays [-@Barnes2013; -@Barnes2013b; -@Barnes2018]. 
The Barnes device was originally intended to reduce variability in operator technique during the plastic limit test.
Barnes realized that stress and strain could be measured during the test and these could be translated to toughness.
This work comprises the only published research which directly measured the toughness of clay soils. 

Major findings by Barnes [-@Barnes2009; -@Barnes2013; -@Barnes2013b; -@Barnes2018] included :

1. New characteristic water contents and indices can be defined in terms of toughness. For example, the toughness coefficient is the rate of change in toughness as a function of water content ($I_T=\frac{\text{d}T}{\text{d}w}$).
2. Both clay-size content and clay-mineral content affect toughness. The general order of decreasing toughness at the plastic limit was montmorillonite > illite > kaolinite.
3. The addition of coarse particles decreased toughness by diluting the clay content. For equal "matrix water content" (i.e. water per unit % < 2&mu;m) coarse particles _increased_ toughness because of the additional work required to shear them through the viscous clay matrix. However, maximum toughness was lower for mixed soils because the presence of coarse particles brought the onset of brittle failure at a higher total water content. The net effect of coarse additions is to raise the plastic limit relative to the pure clay and reduce maximum toughness.
4. Some clays undergo strain-hardening during the rolling procedure, while others exhibit strain-softening behavior. 
5. The toughness of clay mixtures does not always obey a linear law. In other words, the behavior of an artificial mixture containing two clays will not necessarily reflect the mixture's proportions. This phenomenon is re-visited in Section \@ref(multiple-clay-type-mixtures). 

The Barnes apparatus marks a significant advance, but it represents only one means of measuring soil toughness. 
It is a single, unique apparatus so there is no information about the reproducibility of its results across operators. 
There is also no research comparing its results with other means of measuring soil toughness. 


Clays exhibit toughness during many types of strain, not only the harmonic thread-rolling typical of the plastic limit test which the Barnes device seeks to emulate. 
Similarly, the plastic limit does not represent the true limit of ductile behavior; it merely establishes a useful but arbitrary threshold for a single type of deformation. 
A soil can undergo ductile strain even when its water content lies below the canonical plastic limit. 
This is readily observed when classifying soils with the USDA field texture evaluation. This method involves forming a ribbon with the thumb and fingers. 
A soil can often be "ribboned" but will crumble if rolled.



#### Computing toughness from index properties

@Casagrande1932 extended his commentary about soil toughness to include its potential utility for soil classification:

>"In order to classify clays according to their toughness it would be necessary to determine the shearing resistance at the plastic limit by means of a  direct shearing test or an unconfined compression test. "

The language above suggests Casagrande favored the use of a direct toughness measurement, but he also derived a formula to estimate a soil's toughness.

The formula assumes a semi-logarithmic relationship between water content and shear strength exists over the whole range of plasticity. 
It uses the flow index derived from the liquid limit test to extrapolate the shear strength at the plastic limit. 
A steeper flow curve indicates less change in shear strength for a unit increase in water content. 
@Casagrande1932 termed the resulting formula was termed "toughness index":

\begin{equation}
I_t = \frac{PI}{F} 
(\#eq:casagrande-toughness-index)
\end{equation}

where $I_t$ is the toughness index, $PI$ is the plasticity index, and $F$ is the slope of the flow curve. 

@Moreno-Maroto2018 correlated the plastic and liquid limits with maximum toughness ($T_{max}$) measured by @Barnes2013. 
By re-arranging their equation, toughness is computed as:

\begin{equation}
T_{max}=\frac{130~\cdot~PI}{LL}-44
(\#eq:moreno-maroto-toughness)
\end{equation}
 
@Moreno-Maroto2018 also suggested a new basis for classifying fine-grained soils based on their toughness equation (Figure \@ref(fig:moreno-maroto-chart)) and qualitative observations [@Moreno-Maroto2017].

```{r moreno-maroto-chart, fig.cap='Soil classification chart proposed by Moreno-Maroto and Alonso-Azcárate (2018). Toughness data from Barnes (2013) and the empirical equation from Moreno-Maroto and Alonso-Azcárate (2018) were used to define the positions of the C-line and M-line.', fig.scap='Toughness-based soil classification chart'}
source('draw_moreno-maroto_chart.R')
moreno_maroto_chart
```

They retained the existing groups in the USCS but added additional groups for soils intermediate between silts and clays. 
The new chart eliminated the A-line and instead defined two new boundaries: the C-line to separate clays from intermediate soils and the M-line to separate intermediate soils from silts. The lines were drawn on the basis of toughness computed from their equation \@ref(eq:moreno-maroto-toughness) and converted to LL and PL values.  

@Moreno-Maroto2018 also pointed out that the slopes of their C-line and M-line closely match the toughness groups given by @Barnes2009.
An advantage of this new classification system is that it is based on a continuous, quantitative property (toughness).
A limitation is that toughness is computed from an empirical equation and not measured directly.

Moreno-Maroto and Alonso-Azcárate later compared their own classification system with other systems based on plasticity [@Moreno-Maroto2021].
In the latter paper the authors noted that USCS tends to classify soils having high LL and low toughness as clays. They argued that the behavior of these soils is more silt-like and that their M- and C-lines clarify this distinction. 

The author considers the above debate rather circular. 
_Any_ attempt to classify soils into groups invokes a degree of arbitrariness. 
A pedantic debate about "silt-like" and "clay-like" behavior typifies the murky business of classifying natural entities into discrete bins. 

There are no universally agreed-upon definitions of "clay" and "silt," although a number of academic and professional societies maintain their own official language (for example, @Guggenheim1995). These terms' working definitions are context-specific; the qualities important to the earthworks engineer differ from that of the potter, which differ from that of the geologist and so on. 
Despite these limitations, the emphasis on toughness by Moreno-Maroto and Alonso-Azcárate [-@Moreno-Maroto2018; -@Moreno-Maroto2021] is important and should be explored further. 


@Vinod2017 also used data from @Barnes2013 to form an empirical correlation. 
Their objective was to predict the optimum moisture content for compaction at any compaction effort without actually performing a Proctor-style compaction test. They hypothesized that the optimum water content for compaction could be predicted from another property defined by @Barnes2013, termed the toughness limit $w_T$. 
Barnes defined the toughness limit as the water content where a soil changes from an unworkable, adhesive consistency to a state having measurable toughness.
@Vinod2017 first correlated the toughness limits of the 59 soils tested by @Barnes2013 with their respective liquidity indexes ($I_L$, defined as $I_L=LL - PL$). 
They found that the average position of the toughness limit was $PL + 0.42 \cdot I_L$. 
In other words, the toughness limit was 42% of the way between the plastic and liquid limits. 
This correlation was then used to develop an empirical equation to predict the optimum water content from the plastic limit, liquid limit, and compaction energy. 
The authors reported a good correlation, but the spread of their data shows that the $w_{opt}$ measured with an actual compaction test routinely differed by 0.05-0.10 from the value predicted by their equation. 
This equation may be useful for initial characterization, but it seems unlikely that an empirical equation could completely replace compaction testing.

#### Summary: soil toughness research

Research on soil toughness is limited. 
Toughness is the total work needed to deform a specimen to failure. 
Work by G. Barnes produced a useful device which directly measures toughness during a thread-rolling procedure. 
Empirical correlations can estimate soil toughness, but these should be validated with further experimentation.

### Summary: laboratory tests of soil behavior and physical properties

<!-- The purpose of laboratory soil testing is to provide information about a soil's  -->
<!-- nature or properties in a field setting. -->
<!-- In the context of infield mixes, soil testing is used to predict how a material will respond to changes in water content and its interactions with projectiles and athlete's cleated footwear. -->
This section has reviewed research on the nature and efficacy of various soil tests. 

Particle size analysis is the only soil test method which has been applied to infield soils research. 
There is reason to believe this concept does not accurately reflect the performance of all infield soils.
The wide variety of methods employed in PSA also makes comparing results difficult.
The Atterberg limit tests are well-accepted and despite their known shortcomings may provide an alternative means for assessing infield soils. 
Soil toughness is another useful concept for studying infield soils. 
However, little research on soil toughness is available.
Work by G. Barnes has shown that clay mineralogy and coarse additions both affect soil toughness.

## Artificial soil mixtures {#artificial-soil-mixtures}

<!-- these first two sections need to be pared down and combined (the ones introducing the section and the one the rationale for producing engineered soils -->

Natural materials do not always meet the requirements for a particular use. 
Natural soil solids are commonly excavated and blended to benefit their physical or chemical properties [@Brady2007].^[Potters and brick masons in antiquity were likely first to mix soils together.
Un-fired bricks containing clay mixed with organic residues have been dated to over 9,000 years before the present [@Staubach2005].]
These soils have been termed engineered soils [@Thompson2008a].


@Seed1964a succinctly described the importance of engineered soils:

>"Blending of two soils, producing a new soil with characteristics better than both of its constituents, would be an interesting addition to soil stabilization techniques."

Engineered soils afford two advantages:

1. Improved properties
1. Consistent production over time 

The latter refers to a soil supplier's capacity for producing the same mixture again and again.
If the raw components are found to vary, the mixture can be adjusted so the final properties do not change.

Engineered soils are now used for agricultural, horticultural, geotechnical, environmental, and recreational purposes [@Leake2014].
Engineered soil mixtures for baseball and softball fields normally contain two materials - a sand and a fine-grained soil. The finer component is usually termed "clay" without regard to its actual particle-size distribution or mineralogy.

This section reviews literature pertinent to artificial soil mixtures, i.e. engineered soils. 
I focus on studies which have measured compaction, Atterberg limits, and toughness because these are the tests most relevant to baseball and softball infields. 
Other methods which have been used to study coarse-fine mixtures include permeability, shear strength, static compressibility, and pore size distribution.

The organization of this section is as follows:

- Section \@ref(transitional-fines-content) discusses the transitional fines content of coarse-fine mixtures.

- Section \@ref(coarse-fraction-effects-on-soil-mixtures) summarizes the role played by the coarse fraction when mixed with fines. 

- Section \@ref(multiple-clay-type-mixtures) reviews research on soil mixtures containing multiple clay types.

\newpage



### Transitional fines content {#transitional-fines-content}

Loads applied to a coarse-grained soil are transmitted through a skeleton of grain-to-grain contacts.
The soil's behavior is relatively independent of water content.
A minor addition of fine particles will not affect the soil’s behavior so long as the fines fit comfortably within the large voids.

As more fines are added, they begin to participate in the force chain. Eventually the coarse grains lose contact and become completely suspended in a matrix of fines and small inter-fine voids.
This stage has been termed the transitional fines content (TFC).
When $m_{fines} > TFC$, the fines and their water content will dominate the soil's behavior. The coarse grains serve only as inert inclusions.
Figure \@ref(fig:tfc-stages) depicts the various stages which bracket the TFC.

```{r tfc-stages, fig.cap="As fines are added to a pure sand, the nature of the fines and the water content play a greater role in governing the soil's behavior.", fig.scap="Major stages bracketing the transitional fines content.", out.width="99%"}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/pdf/transitional-fines-content-stages.pdf')
```


The TFC is a relevant concept to the design of infield mixes.
Infield soils must exhibit some properties characteristic of fine-grained soils (plasticity, stiffness) and also some more reflective of coarse-grained soils (ease of working with implements).

<!-- this sentence is weak, taking out for now. The following sub-sections review literature on the transitional fines content of soil mixtures. -->

#### Means to define the TFC

Quantitative definitions of the TFC vary (Table \@ref(tab:tfc-definition-methods)).
Regardless of the definition, there is no absolute TFC which applies to all soil mixtures.
Most studies report values of 20-30% fines by dry mass, with extreme values ranging from about 15 to 50%.
TFC values vary across mixtures because the packing arrangement depends on the the grain-size distribution of each component, the plasticity/toughness of the fines, the means of compaction or consolidation, and the state of effective stress [@Zuo2015].

##### TFC defined by maximum total density

The maximum possible density of a coarse-fine mixture occurs when compacted fines just fill the large voids without displacing any of the larger grains (Figure \@ref(fig:tfc-stages), middle panel).
This state represents a simple approximation of the TFC.
Both components are assumed to exist at their maximum densities and the fines are considered "infinitely small" so that no lodging occrs.
@Lade1998 gave a convenient solution for the global packing fraction $V_s$:
  
\begin{equation}
V_{solids}=1-n_{global}=1-\left( n_{coarse}\cdot n_{fines}\right)
(\#eq:global-tfc-void-ratio)
\end{equation}
  
where $n_{global}$ is the porosity of the whole soil and $n_{coarse}$ and $n_{fines}$ represent the porosity of each component.
For example, when mixing a sand having a minimum porosity of 0.35 and a clay having a minimum porosity of 0.4, the theoretical maximum solids volume or "packing fraction" of the mixture is $1-\left(0.35\cdot0.40\right)=0.86$ or 14% porosity.
  
Packing fractions measured in experiments are always lower than predicted by Equation \@ref(eq:global-tfc-void-ratio) [@Zuo2015].
These range from 60% to 95% of their theoretical maxima [@Furnas1931; @McGeary1961; @Zuo2015].
Such disparities probably reflect the calculations' unrealistic assumptions: it is difficult to simultaneously achieve maximum density for both components, and the fines are never "infinitely small" [@Zuo2015].
  
@Cabalar2011 showed that the behavior transition from sand-like to clay-like occurs at a fines content lower than predicted by Equation \@ref(eq:global-tfc-void-ratio).
The intergranular void ratio (discussed next) may give a more accurate prediction of the behavioral threshold.
  
  
#####  TFC defined by increasing intergranular void ratio

A second mathematical means to define the TFC is the intergranular void ratio $e_{sand}$ [@Thevanayagam1998].
This parameter reflects the relative density of the larger grains.
Equation \@ref(eq:intergranular-void-ratio-equation) demonstrates that $e_{sand}$ is derived from phase relations by considering the solid fines as voids:

\begin{align}
e_{sand} &= \frac{V_{voids}}{V_{sand}} \nonumber \\
e_{sand} &= \frac{V_{clay} + V_{water}}{V_{sand}} \nonumber \\
e_{sand} &= \frac{\frac{m_{clay}}{G_{clay}} + \frac{m_{water}}{Gwater}}{\frac{m_{sand}}{G_{sand}}}; \quad m_{water} = w \cdot m_{solids} = w \cdot 1 = w \nonumber \\
e_{sand} &= \frac{\frac{m_{clay}}{G_{clay}} + \frac{{w}}{Gwater}}{\frac{m_{sand}}{G_{sand}}}
(\#eq:intergranular-void-ratio-equation)
\end{align}

Where $G$ represents the specific gravity of a phase and $m$ represents its mass fraction, with $m_{solids} = 1$.

The state of the sand grains can be considered in terms of their porosity rather than their void ratio:

\begin{align}
n_{sa}&=\frac{\frac{\left( m_{c_{mass-based}} \times  \rho_{bulk} \right)}{G_c}+\left( 1 - \frac{\rho_{bulk}}{G_s} \right)}{1}
(\#eq:lit-review-intergranular-porosity-equation)
\end{align}

A more complete derivation of Equation \@ref(eq:lit-review-intergranular-porosity-equation) is given in the Appendix (Section \@ref(generalized-intergranular-porosity-equation)).

```

Figure \@ref(fig:intergranular-void-ratio-diagram) illustrates phase volumes for a hypthetical sand-clay mixture having transitional fines content $TFC=0.25$, i.e. `r 100*rounded_phase_masses$m_sa`% sand by mass. <!-- and $w=$ `r round(phase_diagram_w, digits=3)`.  -->
Assuming full saturation, $V_{sand}=$ `r rounded_phase_volumes$v_sa`, $V_{clay}=$ `r rounded_phase_volumes$v_c`, and $V_{water}=\theta=$ `r rounded_phase_volumes$v_w`. Total volume $V_{total}=1$. $e_{sand}$ is `r round((phase_volumes$v_w + phase_volumes$v_c)/(phase_volumes$v_sa), digits =2)` and $n_{sand}=$ `r round((phase_volumes$v_w + phase_volumes$v_c)/(phase_volumes$v_w + phase_volumes$v_c + phase_volumes$v_sa), digits = 2)`.
These are similar to typical $e_{min}$ or $n_{max}$ values for a pure, uniform sand.

```

@Thevanayagam1998 proposed that $e_{sand}$ at a given $m_{clay}$ and $w$ be compared with the minimum void ratio of the pure "host" sand $e_{max_{pure~sand}}$.
When $e_{sand}$ exceeds $e_{max_{pure~sand}}$, the soil's behavior will no longer be governed by contacts between coarse grains because of their loose configuration.
Therefore @Thevanayagam1998 defined the TFC as the fines content where $e_{sand}=e_{max_{pure~sand}}$ or $n_{sa} = n_{{max}_{pure~sand}}$.


##### Effect of coarse/fine particle size ratio {#tfc-size-ratio}

The solutions described above assume that the fines are infinitely small, fitting completely within the larger grains.
In reality, lodging of fines between the coarse grains often creates additional voids.
@Lade1998 defined a size ratio $R$ as the quotient of each component's mean grain size:

\begin{equation}
R=\frac{D_{50~sand}}{D_{50~fines}} \\
(\#eq:tfc-size-ratio)
\end{equation}


The disparity between calculations and experiments increases with decreasing size ratio [@Lade1998; @Zuo2015].
@Lade1998 concluded that when $R$ < 7, any increase in the size ratio imparts a relatively steep increase in packing density.
For further increases in $R$, the observed void ratio slowly decreases toward its theoretical minimum (Figure \@ref(fig:lade-1998-figure-7)).

```{r lade-1998-figure-7, fig.cap='When the ratio of particle diameters is < 7, increases in the size ratio improve packing density. Above R of 7-10, little density increase is observed. Reproduced from Lade et al. (1998).', fig.scap='Importance of particle diameter ratio for intergranular packing'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('images/illustrations/Lade_1998_Figure_7/Lade_1998_Figure_7.pdf'))
```

@Lade1998 also showed that a void between closely packed spheres of equal sizes has a diameter of ~ $\frac{1}{6.4}$ that of the large particles.
Therefore, there is a fundamental reason for the abrupt change in slope at $R$~7.

Numerical simulations indicate the intergranular void ratio is practically independent of $D_{50~fines}$ when $R$ > 100 [@Ueda2011].

The geometrical calculations by @Lade1998 assume a single particle size for each mix component.
The solid volume $V_s$ of a two-component mixture is further increased when each individual component is well-graded.
@Reed1995 provided solutions for the optimum ratios of multi-phase mixtures when each has a log-normal particle size curve.

##### TFC of mixtures with more than 2 phases

Additional voids may be filled by in a coarse-fine mixture by adding progressively smaller particles.
The overall void volume approaches zero as more components are added.
@McGeary1961 achieved a solids volume of 0.951 (less than 5% porosity) with a four-component mixture.
This extreme packing density could only be achieved by first vibrating the coarsest component to its maximum density, then adding the next finer component and vibrating until it fully penetrated the remaining voids.
@McGeary1961 noted that this mixture could still be poured from its container.


##### Influence of fines plasticity on TFC

Most research on the transitional fines content has focused on sand mixed with non-plastic fines.
This research bias is likely due to the high liquefaction risk posed by silts.
It also may reflect the speed at which the experiments can be performed.
Mixtures of sand with silt can be vibrated to their maximum density in an air-dry condition, while investigations of sand mixed with plastic clay require more laborious dynamic compaction methods [@ASTMD4253-16; @ASTMD698-12e2].
Plasticity index has been positively correlated with optimum water content for compaction [@Sridharan2005a; @Verma2019].
Therefore, by increasing the plasticity of the fines, one would expect the maximum achievable density of a mix to occur at a lower fines content. Compared to a low-plasticity soil, more of the inter-granular space is occupied by water at $w_{opt}$.


##### Effect of compaction/consolidation method on TFC

Mixtures subjected to static compression in an oedometer exhibit typical void ratio vs. log pressure curves.
When this method is used, higher ultimate density values are attained compared to dynamic compaction tests.
The difference in ultimate density can be attributed to more complete evacuation of air from the voids.
A soil compacted at its optimum water content typically retains air in 5-15% of its void volume for $S_e$ values of 0.85-0.95 [@Holtz2010].
Slow consolidation from a saturated condition generates a higher final density because there is no entrapped air.
Oedometer experiments on artificial soil mixtures probably have less practical significance than compaction experiments because engineered soils are usually installed in an unsaturated condition.

#### Summary: transitional fines content

- There is no universal value defining the TFC. Mass percentages range from 15-45% and are specific to a given mixture.

- Factors affecting the TFC value in a binary mixture include sand gradation, plasticity of the fines, and compaction method.

- Soil mixtures are commonly specified by mass (i.e. 70% sand), but behavioral thresholds are better explained using volumetric relations.

- Calculations provide a useful starting point for estimating the TFC.  Experiments are required to determine a more precise value.

### Effect of coarse fraction on mix behavior {#coarse-fraction-effects-on-soil-mixtures}

The influence of clay mineralogy on plasticity is well-known [@Holtz2010].
In general the plasticity of the major clay minerals is Na-montmorillonite > Ca-montmorillonite > illite > kaolinite. 
However, the nature of coarse particles added to a clay will also affect the mixture's properties.
This section covers research on how various types and quantities of coarse additions affects the behavior of a coarse-fine mixture.

#### Total sand content

If the sand grains in a soil mixture act only as inclusions within the clay-water matrix, the liquid limit of the mixture should decrease in direct proportion to sand content.
@Sivapullaiah1985 termed this effect the “linear law of mixtures.”
Three studies on the linear law of mixtures are reviewed below.


@Seed1964a studied the Atterberg limits of sand-clay mixtures. Three types of clay (kaolinite, illite, and Ca-bentonite) were mixed with varying amounts of sand. All of the sand was < 425 μm.

The liquid limits (LL) of the sand-bentonite mixtures were inversely proportional to sand content.
In other words, the LL per unit clay component remained constant.
This relationship was also observed for the illite clay.
The same linear relation was observed for the kaolinite clay up to 50% sand but the liquid limit test could not be performed on the 75% sand-25% kaolinite mixture.
Therefore, it was not clear whether the linear relationship would have persisted between 50 and 75% sand.

@Seed1964a also showed that the slopes of liquid limit vs. sand content lines differed by clay type. 
The slopes were in close agreement with the Skempton activity of the clay, computed as $\frac{LL}{\%~<2~\mu m}$.
The relationship to Skempton activity held regardless of whether the sand was mixed with a single clay or a pre-blended clay mixture.

The plastic limit of the bentonite-sand mixtures also followed a linear relationship up to the highest percent sand tested (75%).
This was not true for illite and kaolinite clays.
For sand content >25%, the plastic limits were higher than predicted by a simple linear regression.
This finding suggests that even a small amount of added sand can affect the behavior of a sand-kaolinite or sand-illite mixture.
The authors tested only 4 sand contents for the illite and 3 sand contents for the kaolinite, so a departure from the linear trend could have begun anywhere between 25 and 75% sand.

@Dumbleton1966a measured the Atterberg limits of 2 types of clay mixed with 5 types of coarse particles. 
Both kaolinite and montmorillonite showed linear decreases in their Atterberg limits up to 50 % sand. 
Like @Seed1964a, the researchers tested only 4 sand contents so the shape of the relationship cannot be clearly discerned above 50% sand. 
The kaolinite evidently became nonplastic at 75% sand, but montmorillonite still had a measurable liquid and plastic limit. 


@Sivapullaiah1985 studied mixes of sand with pure clay materials. 
Their findings were similar to those of @Seed1964a and @Dumbleton1966a.
@Sivapullaiah1985 showed that the linear law is only valid up to a maximum sand content which depends on clay type.
Evidence was given as (1) liquid limits which are systematically higher than predicted by the linear law, and (2) plastic limits _increasing_ with greater sand content once 60% sand was reached, rather than decreasing as expected.

@Sivapullaiah1985 clearly demonstrated that the linear law is not valid over the full range of 0-100% clay, but only one data point was collected between 0 and 60% sand.
Therefore, the shape of the liquid limit vs. sand content curve below 60% sand cannot be discerned from their data.


#### Sand/silt particle size


@Dumbleton1966b mixed coarse sand, fine sand, or silt with either kaolinite or montmorillonite.
For the same percent "coarse addition," coarser sand caused a smaller change in the Atterberg limits while finer sand had a larger effect. The effect of silt was even greater.

The influence of coarse additions' particle size was also tested by  @Sivapullaiah1985.
Both the liquid and plastic limits were affected by the size of the added sand particles.
Mixes containing coarser sand (425 μm – 150 μm) adhered more closely to the linear law of mixtures than finer sand having only particles 150 μm – 75 μm.
Mixes containing added silt deviated even further from the linear law.

@Barnes2013 tested mixes of London clay with sand (two different size fractions) or silt, in 10% increments of coarse particles from 0 to 100% clay. Finer particles decreased a mixture's toughness at its plastic limit. @Barnes2013 argued that increased the clay's toughness was higher at a given 'matrix water content' (water per unit <2&mu;m fraction). This is a somewhat abstract idea because some amount of water always associates with the other particles.

@Rehman2020 tested natural soils (not artificial mixtures) sieved to either 2 mm or 425 &mu;m.
There was little difference in the PL and LL for soils with LL < 35.
When the LL exceeded 35, greater discrepancies were observed.
This result is not surprising given the higher specific surface area of finer particles.
The authors did not specify whether the sieving procedure was performed wet or dry.


Note that with the exception of @Rehman2020, all the above studies used sand exclusively < 425 &mu;m. 
Many infield mixes contain significant mass percentages of sand larger than this diameter.


#### Sand uniformity

The uniformity of sand included in soil mixtures has not been studied extensively.
@Dumbleton1966b found that mixes made with broadly-graded sand had similar Atterberg limits to mixes containing sand from a single mesh size.
However, a detailed particle size distribution was not given in this study so it is difficult to know how different the uniformity was between the sands.
It could be assumed that 100% of the sand passed the #40 sieve (425 &mu;m) because this is the standard range of allowed sand sizes in Atterberg limit tests.
If this were the case, the range of sand particle diameters would only fall between ~50 to 425 &mu;m.
This is a relatively narrow range which would preclude efficient particle packing (see Section \@ref(tfc-size-ratio)). It is possible the uniformity would have more incluence if coarser sand were used in the mixture.


#### Sand particle shape


Dumbleton and West [-@Dumbleton1966b] studied the influence of the coarse fraction’s shape on Atterberg limits. 
Increasing departure from spherical and round particles tended to raise both the liquid and plastic limits by roughly equivalent amounts. 
For the same mass percent of coarse addition, the increase in the plastic limit was platy mica silt > bulky quartz silt > angular quartz sand > round quartz sand. 
The authors attributed the difference to irregularly-shaped particles having higher surface area and requiring more water to coat the particles. 



@Sivapullaiah1985 found no effect of sand particle shape on the Atterberg limits.
Bentonite clay was mixed with equal amounts of either angular or round sand of the same particle size fraction (150 μm – 75 μm). Sand contents ranged from 20 - 95 %. 
There was no discernible difference in the liquid or plastic limits.
This finding differs from those of @Dumbleton1966b, which showed a measureable difference between angular and round particles of the same size fraction.




### Artificial clay mixtures {#multiple-clay-type-mixtures}

When clays are deliberately mixed, the mixture's properties do not always reflect the ratio of its components. One clay may dominate the behavior.
@Seed1964a extended their work on sand-clay mixes to include three-component mixtures, in which two types of pure clay were first combined before adding the sand.
Adding kaolinite to either illite or smectite had a roughly proportional effect on the Atterberg limits.
For example, a mix with a mass percent 50% kaolinite and 50% illite had a liquid limit halfway between the liquid limits of each individual clay.

Mixtures of smectite with illite did not adhere to this linear interpolation.
The liquid limits of the smectite-illite mixes were always lower than predicted by the linear law.
Small additions of illite to smectite lowered the LL by more than expected, and small additions of smectite to illite raised the LL by less than expected.
An opposite effect was observed for the plastic limit. With small bentonite additions, the plastic limit was lower than expected, while for larger bentonite additions it was higher than expected.

@Dumbleton1966b measured Atterberg limits of mixtures containing montmorillonite and kaolinite. 
Their results were similar to those of @Seed1964a. 
The LL and PL were suppressed below the values predicted from a linear interpolation between the two clays' values. Figure \@ref(fig:dumbleton-west-1666b-fig8-redraw) shows this discrepancy.

```{r dumbleton-west-1666b-fig8-redraw, fig.cap='Data from Dumbleton and West (1966b) show the behavior of a clay mixture is not a simple linear interpolation between its components\' properties. Similar results were obtained by Seed et al. (1964) and Sivapullaiah and Sridharan (1985).', fig.scap='Atterberg limits of clay mixtures (from Dumbleton and West, 1966b)'}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/pdf/dumbleton-west-1966b-fig8-redraw.pdf')
```

Similarly, @Sivapullaiah1985 showed that their linear law was not valid for mixtures of bentonite with kaolinite. 
The liquid limit of the mixture was always lower than would be expected. 

@Barnes2018 studied the toughness of clay mixtures. 
Various ball clay were combined to produce two-component mixtures containing 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% of each component by volume.
This differs from most other studies which use mass-based relations for mixing.
A single ball clay was also mixed with a fireclay of low plastcity.
All the clays were kaolinite-dominated, but detailed mineralogy data were not collected.

In 2 of the 3 mixture pairings, the plastic limits of the mixtures were suppressed compared to those predicted by a linear law. 
The pure AT and KT ball clays had nearly identical plastic limits (~30%), but the plastic limits of mixtures containing these clays was always less than 30%. 
By lowering the plastic limit more than the liquid limit, the overall range of water contents where the mix was plastic was extended.
Critically, the maximum toughness of the mixture (i.e. at its plastic limit) was also increased over that of either pure clay.


Clay bodies for ceramic applications are commonly manufactured by adding 1-3% bentonite [@Chappell1991]. 
This minute addition is sufficient to increase the mixture's toughness and plasticity.

Collectively, the studies described above demonstrate that the behavior of clay mixtures can be drastically different from that of the pure clays. 

### Summary: behavior of artificial soil mixtures

Soils are often mixed to beneficiate their physical properties.
These artificial mixtures have been termed engineered soils.

The transitional fines content has been defined in various ways. 
There is no universal TFC value, but typical values are 20-30% by mass.
Dominant factors which determine the TFC for a pair of soils include their mean particle sizes, the host sand's void volume, the plasticity of the fines, and the means of compaction.

Coarse particles added to a finer soil can affect the mixture's behavior even at sand contents <50%.
The influence is most pronounced for finer and more irregularly-shaped particles.
These additions reduce the mixture's plasticity and toughness.

Multiple clay minerals are sometimes blended together. 
Mixing one clay with another yields a material whose properties are difficult to predict.


## Summary: Review of Literature


This literature review summarized research pertaining to 3 main areas:

1. Surface properties of baseball infields
1. Laboratory testing for soil behavior and physical properties
1. Design and function of artificial soil mixtures.


The review identified several areas where existing research is lacking. These include the following:

1. There is no existing research on the cleat-in, cleat-out effect.
1. There has been no comparison of infield soils having similar textures but different mineralogy.
1. Soil toughness has only been explored using a single device which has limited scope.
1. Existing research on sand-clay mixes has not used sand with particles > 425 μm. This type of sand is common in infield mixes. 


This project attempts to address the topics above with original experiments.
These are outlined in Section \@ref(proposed-experiments).
