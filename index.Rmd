Baseball fields are built from soil. Therefore, soil behavior determines the safety and function of the field. The purpose of this dissertation is to assess and improve the behavior of soil mixtures used on baseball infields. 

The production of soil mixtures has received much study. However, there are no published experiments on this topic as it pertains to baseball and
softball fields.

This thesis proposal is organized into four sections:

[**Purpose and objectives**](#purpose-objectives): A broad description of the scope and aims of the project

[**Definition of terms**](#definition-of-terms): Explicit meanings of verbiage used this document (these may vary across scientific fields)

[**Review of literature**](#lit-review): A summary of scientific research pertaining to baseball/softball fields, laboratory soil testing methods, and the behavior of artificial soil mixtures

[**Proposed experiments**](#proposed-experiments): The planned course of laboratory research, organized as anticipated publication units
