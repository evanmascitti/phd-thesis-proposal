# Overview {#overview}

Baseball fields are built from soil. Therefore, soil behavior determines the safety and function of the field. The purpose of this dissertation is to study how soil behavior relates to baseball infields. 

The production of artificial soils has received much study. However, there are
no published scientific experiments on this topic as it pertains to baseball and
softball fields.

This proposal is organized into three sections:

[**Purpose and objectives**](#purpose-objectives): A broad description of the scope and aims of the project

[**Definition of terms**](#definition-of-terms): Explicit meanings of verbiage used this document (these may vary across scientific fields)

[**Review of literature**](#lit-review): A summary of scientific research pertaining to this topic

[**Proposed experiments**](#proposed-experiments): The planned course of laboratory research, organized as anticipated publication units.
