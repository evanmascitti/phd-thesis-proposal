# Executive summary



This document outlines the research progress I have made since beginning my PhD in 2019 and describes my plans for completing the project.

It is divided into 3 main sections:

[**Purpose and objectives**](#purpose-objectives): A broad description of the scope and aims of the project.

[**Review of literature**](#lit-review): Summary of scientific research relevant to my project. Includes 3 major sub-sections: (1)  pertaining to baseball/softball fields, (2) laboratory soil testing methods, and (3) the behavior of artificial soil mixtures.

[**Proposed experiments**](#proposed-experiments): The planned course of laboratory research, organized as anticipated publication units.


In addition, I have included two shorter sections: a definition of terms (Section \@ref(definition-of-terms)) (since many have different meanings across scientific fields) and a description of my workflow and data management plan (Section \@ref(workflow)). 
The latter is written informally. It has nothing to do with the technical/soils aspects of my research, but I've included it because it comprises an important practical part of completing my degree.

The proposal concludes with an Appendix housing a few tables and my References.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

options(tinytex.verbose = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE,
                      echo = FALSE,
                      warning = FALSE)

```
