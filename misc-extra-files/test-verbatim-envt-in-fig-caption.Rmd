Can't get verbatim to work inside a figure caption. 

It seems to be a LaTeX issue, not a bookdown issue.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F, warning = F, message = F)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = here::here())
```

This is a test of the use of verbatim environment inside a figure caption. 

```{r example-make-dependency-graph, out.width='90%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Dependency graph of a minimal example Makefile.'}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here(
  'example-mf-project/dependency-graph.png')
)
```
