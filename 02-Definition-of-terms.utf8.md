**clay**:

:  a soil material which can be reshaped or molded when moist and which develops high strength when dry

 **clay-size**:

:  an individual mineral grain which settles in through a column of fluid at the same rate as a spherical particle having 2 &mu;m diameter

 **clay mineral**:

:  a class of silicate minerals having a layered, sheet-like atomic structure

 **cleat-in/cleat-out**:

:  The condition of an infield soil in which no soil clods are removed by an athlete's cleated footwear

 **critical water content ($\theta_{crit}$)**:

:  Value of volumetric water content where an infield soil abruptly changes between a ductile, cleat-in/cleat-out condition and a brittle clod-forming yield mode

 **gravimetric water content ($w$)**:

:  gravimetric water content, computed as the mass of water associated with a soil sample divided by mass of oven-dry soil solids

 **infield skin**:

:  portion of a baseball or softball field comprising bare soil, excluding the warning track and the pitcher's mound/home plate areas

 **packing fraction ($V_{s}$)**:

:  the volume fraction occupied by solids, normalized to the total soil volume ($1-\text{void fraction}$)

 **sand**:

:  a soil material which is predominantly composed of mineral particles having sieve diameters between 50 and 2000 &mu;m

 **sand-size**:

:  a soil particle having a sieve diameters between 50 and 2000 &mu;m (USDA-NRCS definition)

 **void fraction ($V_{v}$)**:

:  the volume fraction _not_ occupied by solids, normalized to the total soil volume ($1- \text{packing fraction}$)

 **volumetric water content ($\theta$)**:

:  volumetric water content, computed as the volume of soil water divided by the bulk soil volume (i.e. solids plus voids)
