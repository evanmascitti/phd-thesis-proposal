# Purpose {#purpose}

The motive for initiating this research is simple: baseball has a pervasive influence on the American culture and economy, yet science has paid little attention to the surface on which it is played. (could move to another section? Want to describe the \$value of athlete safety and getting the game in)

# Objectives {#objectives}

The objectives of my thesis are twofold: (1) create a new way to assess infield soil performance, and (2) use the new framework to design improved soil mixtures. 

**My intent is to answer these open-ended questions:**

1. How can infield soil performance be objectively quantified?
2. How can the performance of infield soils be improved through rational mix design?
3. Which lab tests can be used to predict the performance of any mix?

**The anticipated outcomes and deliverables from this project are:**
  
1. A general framework for measuring the behavior of sand-clay mixes on baseball and softball fields
2. Specific recommendations for the ratios which a given clayey soil should be mixed with sand for optimal performance at any maintenance level
3. Suggestions for how to beneficiate poorly-performing soils 
4. Refereed journal publications, trade magazine articles, and technical presentations
5. Software programs which may be useful for purposes beyond this project's scope and lifespan
