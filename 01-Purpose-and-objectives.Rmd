## Purpose {#purpose}
The motive for initiating this research is simple: baseball has an important influence on our American culture and economy, yet science has paid little attention to the surface on which it is played. The safety, enjoyment, and economic value of baseball fields can be improved applying the scientific method to this topic

## Objectives {#objectives}

The objectives of my thesis are twofold: (1) create a new way to assess infield soil performance, and (2) use the new framework to design improved soil mixtures. 

**My intent is to answer these open-ended questions:**

1. How can infield soil performance be objectively quantified?
2. How can the performance of infield soils be improved?
3  Can a rational basis for mix design be developed to reflect soil behavior?
3. Which lab tests best to predict the performance of a mix?

**The anticipated outcomes from this research are:**
  
1. New laboratory methods for measuring the behavior of baseball and softball infield soils
2. A quantitative framework for designing new infield mixes and amending existing infields
3. Refereed journal publications, trade magazine articles, and technical presentations
4. Software which can be used beyond this project's scope and lifespan
