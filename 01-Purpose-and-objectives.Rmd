# Purpose and objectives {#purpose-objectives}

The purpose of my thesis is twofold: (1) create a new way to assess infield soil performance, and (2) use the new framework to design improved soil mixtures. 

**My objective is to answer these open-ended questions:**

1. How can infield soil performance be objectively quantified?
2. What can be done to improve the performance of soils currently in use?
3. Which lab tests can be used to predict the performance of any mix?

**The anticipated outcomes and deliverables from this project are:**
  
1. A general framework for measuring the behavior of sand-clay mixes on baseball and softball fields
2. Specific recommendations for the ratios which common clayey soils should be mixed with sand for optimal performance at any maintenance level
3. Suggestions for how to beneficiate poorly-performing soils 
4. Four refereed journal publications
5. Software programs which may be useful for purposes beyond this project's scope and lifespan
