# Purpose and objectives {#purpose-objectives}

The purpose of my thesis is to create a new way to think about the soils used on baseball and softball infields. 

**My objective is to answer these open-ended questions:**

1. How can infield soil performance be quantified without an experienced grounds manager's expertise?
2. How can an infield soil mixture be designed to achieve a given set of desired properties?
3. What simple lab tests can be used to predict the performance of the mix?

**The anticipated outcomes and deliverables from this project are:**
  
1. A general framework for understanding the behavior of sand-clay mixes in a quantitative way
2. Specific recommendations for the ratios which common clayey soils should be mixed with sand for optimal performance at any maintenance level
3. Suggestions for how to beneficiate poorly-performing clay soils with other kinds of clays to maximize the locally available materials by "spiking" the local clay with a small percentage of imported solum
