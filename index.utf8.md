# Executive summary

This document outlines the research progress I have made since beginning my PhD in 2019 and describes my plans for completing the project.

It is divided into 4 main sections:

[**Purpose and objectives**](#purpose-objectives): A broad description of the scope and aims of the project.

[**Problem description**](#problem-description): Outlines the importance of the infield skin in baseball and softball.

[**Review of literature**](#lit-review): Summary of relevant prior scientific research. Includes 3 major sub-sections: (1) research on baseball/softball infields, (2) laboratory soil testing methods, and (3) the behavior of artificial soil mixtures.

[**Proposed experiments**](#proposed-experiments): Planned course of laboratory research, organized as anticipated publication units.


In addition, I have included two shorter sections: a glossary (Section \@ref(definition-of-terms)) and a description of my workflow and data management plan (Section \@ref(workflow)). 
The latter is written informally. It is un-related to the technical/soils aspects of my research, but I've included it because it comprises an important practical part of completing my degree.

The proposal concludes with an Appendix housing a few tables and the References.
