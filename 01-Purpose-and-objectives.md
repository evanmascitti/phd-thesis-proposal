# Purpose and Objectives {#purpose-and-objectives}



## Purpose {#purpose}

Baseball fields can be improved by using the scientific method. 
A high-quality playing surface enhances the safety, enjoyment, and economic value of the game at all levels of play.
<!-- Many parties stand to benefit from baseball field research because the game plays a major role in America's economy and culture. -->
Potential beneficiaries include grounds managers, soil suppliers, contractors, professional franchises, recreation associations, and the athletes themselves.

## Objectives {#objectives}

**The goals of my thesis are twofold:**

1. Create a new way to assess infield soil performance.
2. Use the new framework to design improved soil mixtures.
<!-- **I seek to answer these open-ended questions:** -->

<!-- 1. How can infield soil performance be measured? -->
<!-- 2. How can rational mix design improve infield soil performance? -->
<!-- 3. Which soil tests best predict the performance of a mix? -->

These may be re-stated as formal objectives:

**Objective 1.** 

:  Develop laboratory methods to pinpoint the two critical water contents for any infield soil:

a) the transition from a cleat-in/cleat-out yield mode to chip-forming or clod-forming failure

b) the threshold at which the soil cannot provide adequate resistance for safe playing conditions
    
**Objective 2.** 

:  Demonstrate that the difference between 1(a) and 1(b) can be extended by systematically varying the components of a soil mixture. 

<!-- Objective 3. Determine the optimal means of predicting a soil's performance through laboratory testing. -->
