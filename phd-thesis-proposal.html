<h1 number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Overview</h1>
<p>Baseball fields are built from soil. Therefore, soil behavior determines the safety and function of the field. The purpose of this dissertation is to assess and improve the behavior of soil mixtures used on baseball infields.</p>
<p>The production of soil mixtures has received much study. However, there are no published experiments on this topic as it pertains to baseball and
softball fields.</p>
<p>This thesis proposal is organized into four sections:</p>
<p><a href="#purpose-objectives"><strong>Purpose and objectives</strong></a>: A broad description of the scope and aims of the project</p>
<p><a href="#definition-of-terms"><strong>Definition of terms</strong></a>: Explicit meanings of verbiage used this document (these may vary across scientific fields)</p>

<div id="purpose" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2 number="2.1"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Purpose</h2>
<p>Baseball fields can be improved by using the scientific method.
A high-quality playing surface enhances the safety, enjoyment, and economic value of the game at all levels of play.
Many parties stand to benefit from research on baseball fields because the game plays a major role in America’s economy and culture.</p>
</div>
<div id="objectives" class="section level2" number="2.2">
<h2 number="2.2"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Objectives</h2>
<p><strong>The goals of my thesis are twofold:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>create a new way to assess infield soil performance</li>
</ol>
<p>and</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>use the new framework to design improved soil mixtures.
<!-- **I seek to answer these open-ended questions:** --></li>
</ol>
<!-- 1. How can infield soil performance be measured? -->
<!-- 2. How can rational mix design improve infield soil performance? -->
<!-- 3. Which soil tests best predict the performance of a mix? -->
<p>These may be re-stated as formal objectives:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Develop a laboratory method to pinpoint each of the two critical water contents for any infield soil:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>the transition from cleat-in/cleat-out behavior to chip-forming or clod-forming failure</p></li>
<li><p>the threshold at which the soil cannot provide adequate resistance for safe footing</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Demonstrate that the difference between 1(a) and 1(b) can be extended by systematically varying the components of a soil mixture.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the optimal means of predicting a soil’s performance through laboratory testing.</p></li>

<div id="importance-of-the-infield" class="section level2" number="4.2">
<h2 number="4.2"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Importance of the infield</h2>
<p>Portions of a baseball field are termed <strong>skin</strong> if they comprise bare soil rather than natural grass or synthetic turf.
The pitcher’s mound and the area immediately surrounding home plate are considered distinct; these are constructed and maintained somewhat differently from the infield skin.
This thesis will not treat the mound or home plate areas in detail.
Therefore, in this document the terms “skin” and “infield skin” are used interchangeably.</p>
<p>A full-size baseball field occupies about 1 ha. Roughly 75% of this total area is surfaced with natural turfgrass or synthetic turf.
An additional 15% is occupied by the warning track, which is alerts players that they are nearing the wall by its changing feel underfoot.
Only about 10% of the total playing surface is occupied by the infield skin.</p>
<!-- I like the passage below, and I did spend a few hours finding the data/reference....but not sure it fits here. Thus I am saving it but commenting out. -->
<!-- It is in the defense's interest to encourage the offense to hit as many ground balls as possible, and this heightens the importance of the infield skin. In Major League Baseball (MLB), the average ground ball produces 0.04 runs while causing 0.80 outs. In contrast, the average ball hit in the air creates 0.23 runs and 0.62 outs. Therefore, on a runs-per-outs basis, a fly ball is nearly _8 times_ as valuable to the offense as a ground ball [@Carruth2010].  -->
<p>To motivate the significance of the infield skin, consider Figures @ref(fig:player-locations)-@ref(fig:labor-per-area).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
All the offensive players, the four infielders, and the pitcher and catcher are standing on skinned areas.
A majority of important plays occur on skinned areas, so the funds and effort devoted to maintaining them are disproportionately large.</p>

<p>Great effort is made by the grounds staff to sustain the infield in a playable condition.
Wet playing conditions are the primary cause of postponements.
A host MLB franchise may lose &gt; $500,000 if a game is canceled because refunds must be offered to fans yet stadium operation costs are fixed.
Therefore, every attempt is made to keep the field in a playable condition and complete the game.
At the youth level, most revenue is driven by concessions and tournament registration fees.
Repeated postponements can undermine a facility’s operating model.
Continuing gameplay during and after rain events is critical for both professional and recreational operations.</p>
<p>Athlete safety is paramount to players’ well-being and to the business success of a professional franchise.
Figure @ref(fig:mlb-salaries) shows the distribution of MLB player salaries for 2019.
The median MLB player salary in 2019 was $1.45 million, with 474 players earning over $1 million and 120 players earning over $10 million.
Figure @ref(fig:mlb-salaries) also shows MLB revenue growth since 1995.
These revenues support hundreds of jobs at each stadium which depend on the athletes’ health and performance.
Players are a franchise’s most valuable asset. A team cannot afford for them be injured by a poor playing surface.</p>

<h5 number="4.2.0.0.1"><span class="header-section-number">4.2.0.0.1</span> The brittle-ductile transition and the “corkboard effect”</h5>
<p>Minimal surface disruption is a crucial element of infield quality.
A smooth playing surface ensures the game’s outcome is decided by the players’ performance alone and not influenced by chance events such as an errant ball bounce.</p>
<p>Grounds managers consider ideal infield performance as follows: an athlete’s studded footwear readily penetrates the soil at footstrike.
The soil provides adequate resistance as the athlete completes his or her maneuver.
The cleats release from the surface without separating any soil solids from the zone surrounding them.
No material adheres to the studs or sole of the shoe.
Thus, surface deformation is limited to a small indentation matching the shape of the stud.
This phenomenon is known as “cleat-in, cleat-out” or "the corkboard effect.“<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>
In contrast, a poor-quality infield is one on which larger clods of soil are readily chipped out of the surface or easily fragmented into powder.</p>
<p>Figure @ref(fig:corkboard-concept) depicts the the corkboard phenomenon and its importance to gameplay.
Small, narrow cleat indentations are unlikely to deflect a ball from its initial path, while larger depressions excavated by player’s cleats (or the soil clods themselves) are impediments which tend to produce an errant bounce.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>A given infield soil moves between these states as its water content changes.
This change in state is formally termed the brittle-ductile transition. The brittle-ductile transition is examined further in this proposal’s literature review (Section @ref(lab-methods-review)), but a brief description is provided here to establish its important link to infield performance.</p>
<p>Some amount of yield must occur for a player’s cleats to penetrate the soil surface.
The mode of yield depends on the water content and the packing arrangement of the soil particles. Yield may be one of two types:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>brittle yield: microcracks propagate through the soil skeleton, eventually coalescing to fracture the soil mass into discrete fragments. These clods adjust their positions to accommodate the cleats and are usually ejected from the depression as the shoe releases. Crumbling or cracking of soil is controlled by the distribution of imperfections or “weakest links” in the soil matrix <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Dexter2004" role="doc-biblioref">Dexter, 2004</a>)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>or</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>ductile yield: soil particles are re-arranged to accommodate the cleat, but the soil mass behaves as a continuum.
No material is sepratated from the surface.
In general, ductile yield attenuates more energy than brittle fracture <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Kuipers1984" role="doc-biblioref">Kuipers, 1984</a>)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>A second important consequence of a ductile yield mode is that if a batted baseball <em>does</em> contact a cleat indentation, the surface will deform a second time. Changes to the ball’s trajectory will be minimal.
This scenario is preferred to a more rigid collision in which the ball is re-directed, possibly leading to a misplay or injury (Figure @ref(fig:corkboard-concept)).</p>
<p>Grounds managers have observed that some soils undergo the brittle-ductile transition rapidly, while other soils can withstand a longer drying period before the behavior change occurs.
Therefore, it seems plausible that infield soils could be designed to maximize the range of water content over which the corkboard phenomenon will persist.</p>
<p>It is emphasized that no scientific investigations of the corkboard effect have been performed.
It is a solely qualitative description of soil behavior, and at present no metrics exist for its study.</p>

<p>Baseball was first played in the early 19th century, but the definitive origins of the game are likely lost to history <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Walker1994" role="doc-biblioref">Walker et al., 1994</a>)</span>.
The earliest recorded attempt to alter the physical properties of an infield soil was by Harry Wright in 1875.
Wright and his contemporaries incorporated various materials into their infield soils to enhance stability, firmness, or drainage of the playing surface.
Amendments included organic debris (straw, ashes) and and inorganic materials (sand, lime, cinders) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Morris2007" role="doc-biblioref">Morris, 2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Infield soil mixes were produced off-site and imported beginning in the 1960s ?Zwasksa?.</p>
<p>Popularity of engineered infield mixes has grown markedly since 2005. Today the majority of professional stadia utilize an engineered soil for their infield skin <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Hagerty2018" role="doc-biblioref">Hagerty, 2018</a>)</span>.</p>

<h3 number="4.2.2"><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Summary - importance of the infield skin</h3>
<p>The infield skin is a crucial component of baseball’s competitive and business operations.
A professional grounds crew expends significant effort to maintain the soil water content within a relatively narrow range.
An ideal infield surface exhibits a combination of plasticity and stiffness.
The soil must readily deform around the cleats so that they are not rejected, but it must also provide enough resistance to prevent the athlete from losing traction.
A soil which exhibits these properties over a wide range of water contents increases the odds of completing a game during a rain event, and it allows the groundskeeper a larger margin for error when hand-watering.</p>
<hr />
<p>so the soil must sustain its desired consistency for a period of several hours. Water content may change in either direction during the game. Therefore, a soil which sustains the desired consistency over a broad range of water contents makes the field perform better and eases the groundskeeper’s task.</p>
<hr />
<p>A skilled grounds crew takes great care to maintain the soil at the desired moisture.
Water is manually added with hoses, and rain is kept off using a large tarpaulin.
Soil water content can only be controlled during field preparation; after the game begins, no further adjustments can be made and weather conditions determine the rate of water loss or gain.

<h2 number="5.1"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Performance of baseball infield surfaces</h2>
<p>In baseball and softball, athletes engage with the playing surface in two ways: directly (by running, pivoting, and sliding) and indirectly (by fielding batted balls).
Footing and ball response are the main surface properties of interest to the athlete and the grounds manager.</p>
<p>Published research on baseball infields is relatively scant. Studies relevant to footing and ball response are summarized below.</p>
<hr />
<div id="footing" class="section level3" number="5.1.1">

<div id="traction" class="section level4" number="5.1.1.1">
<h4 number="5.1.1.1"><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1.1</span> Traction</h4>
<p>Traction allows the athlete to run, change directions, and perform other maneuvers without slipping, sliding, or otherwise losing control.
Traction is distinct from planar friction because of the presence of studs or other gripping aids on the players’ footwear <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-McNitt1997a" role="doc-biblioref">McNitt et al., 1997</a>)</span>.
Even when using machine tests (rather than human subjects), measuring traction is complicated by nonlinear interactions between surface type, shoe type, and loading weights <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Nigg1990" role="doc-biblioref">Nigg, 1990</a>)</span>.
Excessive rotational traction is associated with lower extremity injuries, but traction differences among shoe types are often larger than those across surface types <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Serensits2014" role="doc-biblioref">Serensits and McNitt, 2014</a>)</span>.
Clear-cut thresholds separating acceptable and unaccpetable traction have not been established.</p>
<p>Most athletic field research has focused on natural grass and synthetic turf.
There are two published accounts of traction measurements on infield skin surfaces.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Goodall2005" role="doc-biblioref">Goodall et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Goodall2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> measured traction on plots constructed from 5 different soils blended with 4 rates of calcined clay.
Higher traction levels were reported for silty and loamy soils than for sandier soils.
Mixing the soil with calcined clay prior to plot construction had no effect on traction.
No relationship was found between traction and water content, although only 3 water contents were tested.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Brosnan2011" role="doc-biblioref">Brosnan et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Brosnan2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> measured traction on research plots of the same infield soil subjected to various treatments.
Traction was increased by soil compaction and decreased by surficial additions of calcined clay.</p>

<h4 number="5.1.1.2"><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1.2</span> The “corkboard effect”</h4>
<p>The nature of cleat indentations could be considered an element of footing.
However, this topic has not been studied in scientific experiments and no primary literature is available.
A description has been provided in the problem description portion of this proposal (Section @ref(problem-description)).
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Zwaska2007" role="doc-biblioref">Zwaska</a> (<a href="#ref-Zwaska2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span> also described the corkboard concept and other desirable properties of the infield skin.</p>

<div id="ball-response" class="section level3" number="5.1.2">
<h3 number="5.1.2"><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2</span> Ball response</h3>
<p>The reaction of a baseball upon contact with the surface plays a key role in the outcome of competition (recall Figures @ref(fig:labor-per-area)-@ref(fig:batted-ball-density)).
As with footing, limited research is available on infield ball response.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Goodall2005" role="doc-biblioref">Goodall et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Goodall2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> is the only published account of controlled research on multiple infield soils.
The authors installed 5 soils which were commercially available within the northeastern United States.
Static and dynamic ball friction were measured along with traction and other soil properties.
The authors found that increases in water content raised the coefficients of static and dynamic friction between the ball and the soil surface.
The increase was likely due to greater ball penetration, increasing the contact area between the ball and the surface and also prolonging their interaction.
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Goodall2005" role="doc-biblioref">Goodall et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Goodall2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> suggested that surface pace may be more related to friction than to hardness.
This agrees with intuition because the main component of a ground ball’s velocity is horizontal (nearly coplanar with the surface), favoring the importance of horizontal friction rather than vertical rebound.
Incorporation of calcined clay (particle size 0.5 - 2 mm) also decreased friction, especially for finer-textured soils.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Brosnan2011" role="doc-biblioref">Brosnan et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Brosnan2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> studied the effects of construction and maintenance activities on infield surface pace.
Water content was negatively correlated with surface pace, but no attempt was made to intentionally alter water content among plots.
Higher bulk density <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{bulk}\)</span> increased surface pace.
However, Figure @ref(fig:lit-review-density-comparison) shows that the density values reported by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Goodall2005" role="doc-biblioref">Goodall et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Goodall2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> and <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Brosnan2011" role="doc-biblioref">Brosnan et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Brosnan2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> may not be representative of professionally-managed infield skins.
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Brosnan2011" role="doc-biblioref">Brosnan et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Brosnan2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> also found that topdressing plots with calcined clay had no effect on pace, nor did scarifying the surface by up to 2 cm.</p>

<p>The effect of ball spin may be large or small depending on the the ball-surface friction coefficient <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Daish1972" role="doc-biblioref">Daish, 1972</a>; <a href="#ref-Cross2019" role="doc-biblioref">Cross, 2019</a>)</span>.
Low friction cases the ball to skid through impact and retain some of its original spin.
Higher friction allows the ball to ‘grip’ the surface and roll through impact.
Skilled cricket bowlers readily exploit this property on a moist wicket to redirect the ball <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Daish1972" role="doc-biblioref">Daish, 1972</a>)</span>.
In the high-friction case, initial spin is fully attenuated after impact and the new spin rate is controlled by the ball’s original velocity and the friction coefficient.
The release angle will be more affected by a high-friction surface (Figure @ref(fig:daish-spin-release-angle)).</p>
<p>When soil stiffness is low, the ball produces a notable indentation of the surface (Figure @ref(fig:ball-indentation-release-angle)).
An important consequence of the larger deformation is that the contact area between the ball and the surface is increased.
This prolongs the impact duration and allows friction more time to attenuate spin and forward velocity <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Daish1972" role="doc-biblioref">Daish, 1972</a>)</span>.
As the ball releases, it rolls up the saucer-like depression created by its own impact at a slightly steeper angle compared to a rigid surface (Figure @ref(fig:ball-indentation-release-angle)).
A moderate indentation may be the critical feature linking hardness, bounce, pace, and spin.</p>

<p>Infield skins bear many similarities to cricket pitches, which have been researched more extensively.
Ball response is influenced by soil bulk density, clay content, water content, organic matter, and particle size distribution <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Baker2006" role="doc-biblioref">Baker, 2006</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>A laboratory study on surface friction of cricket soils was made by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Adams2001a" role="doc-biblioref">Adams and Young</a> (<a href="#ref-Adams2001a" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>.
This experiment mixed the same clayey soil with 6 types of coarse amendments.
All final mixes had sand content between 30 and 40% by mass.
Ball-to-surface friction was highest for the mix containing sand between 125-60 μm.
Lower friction was measured for soils with coarser or finer amendments.
Using a suede-type leather increased friction relative to polished leather, implying that the degree of wear on the ball may influence surface pace.</p>

<h2 number="5.2"><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Laboratory tests of soil behavior and physical properties</h2>
<p>The goal of laboratory soil testing is to assess or predict the properties of a soil in the field.
Many laboratory soil tests are costly and time-intensive.
Results from simpler tests are commonly used as surrogate markers for the information yielded by more intensive tests.
The methodology underlying these “surrogate” tests has been studied extensively because much is riding on their precision and accuracy.
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Sherwood1970" role="doc-biblioref">Sherwood</a> (<a href="#ref-Sherwood1970" role="doc-biblioref">1970</a>)</span> performed a large-scale inter-laboratory survey of various soil physical methods.
His conclusion was less than optimistic:</p>
<p>\
&gt;“The results of this investigation….are for the most part rather disturbing, since it is clear that none of [the tests] can be used without quite wide tolerances being placed on the values obtained.”</p>
<p>The questions raised by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Sherwood1970" role="doc-biblioref">Sherwood</a> (<a href="#ref-Sherwood1970" role="doc-biblioref">1970</a>)</span> merit further investigation if a reliable means for testing infield mixes is to be developed.
This section summarizes literature on the two classes of laboratory tests pertinent to infield soils: plasticity tests and particle size analysis.</p>
<div id="plasticity-tests" class="section level3" number="5.2.1">
<h3 number="5.2.1"><span class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> Plasticity tests</h3>
<p>The behavior of fine-grained soil is markedly affected by its water content <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Holtz2010" role="doc-biblioref">Holtz et al., 2010</a>)</span>. Plasticity tests mark the water contents where behavioral thresholds occur for a given soil. This section reviews the tests’ history, methodology, and potential shortcomings.</p>
<div id="atterberg-limits-origins" class="section level4" number="5.2.1.1">
<h4 number="5.2.1.1"><span class="header-section-number">5.2.1.1</span> Origins of Atterberg limit test methods</h4>
<p>The earliest test methods for soil plasticity were developed by Atterberg <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Atterberg1911" role="doc-biblioref">1911</a>; <a href="#ref-Atterberg1974" role="doc-biblioref">1974</a>)</span>.
Plasticity<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> is the tendency of a material to deform under an applied load, without fracturing into multiple pieces, and to retain its new shape when the load is removed <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Andrade2011" role="doc-biblioref">Andrade et al., 2011</a>)</span>.
Atterberg noted that plasticity is easy to observe but does not lend itself to simple measurement.
He showed that soil was plastic only within a finite range of water content which differed for every soil.
He termed the upper boundary the ‘flow limit,’ at which two batches of soil paste flowed together when jarred.
He defined the lower boundary as the ‘rolling limit,’ when the soil had dried enough to become brittle and could no longer be rolled into thin threads.
The difference between the flow limit and the rolling limit was the “plasticity number.”
Today these are known as the liquid limit, plastic limit, and plasticity index.
He defined 3 additional consistency limits, though none are widely used today. These were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upper limit of viscous flow: soil flows easily, similar to water</li>
<li>Adhesion limit: soil no longer adheres to a metal implement</li>
<li>Cohesion limit: lumps of soil can be no longer pressed together with one’s fingers</li>
</ul>
<p>Atterberg concluded that his ‘plasticity number’ was the most reliable means of measuring plasticity but pointed out that it gave no information about the effort required to deform the soil.
He considered the effort needed to remold the soil a separate property, which translates to English as ‘viscosity.’ This distinction will be considered further in Section ref(soil-toughness).</p>
<p>Atterberg’s work has never been fully appreciated in his own discipline of agricultural soil science. His test methods were improved and standardized by geotechnical engineers <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Terzaghi1926" role="doc-biblioref">Terzaghi, 1926</a>; <a href="#ref-Casagrande1932" role="doc-biblioref">Casagrande, 1932</a>)</span>.

He pointed out the value of the tests lied in quantifying an observable phenomenon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every engineer should develop the habit of expressing the plasticity and grain-size characteristics of soils by numerical values rather than adjectives…..the degree of plasticity should be indicated by the estimated value of the plasticity index and not by the words ‘trace of plasticity’ or ‘highly plastic.’” <br> - <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Terzaghi1996" role="doc-biblioref">Terzaghi et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Terzaghi1996" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>)</span></p>

<h4 number="5.2.1.2"><span class="header-section-number">5.2.1.2</span> Modern protocols for Atterberg limits</h4>
<p>Standard test methods typically pair the plastic and liquid limit tests.
In the United States the relevant standards are <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-ASTMD43182018" role="doc-biblioref">ASTM International</a> (<a href="#ref-ASTMD43182018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> and <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-AASHTO2020" role="doc-biblioref">AASHTO</a> (<a href="#ref-AASHTO2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> while <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-BS13771990" role="doc-biblioref">British Standards Institute</a> (<a href="#ref-BS13771990" role="doc-biblioref">1990</a>)</span> is typically cited in Europe.
The United States methods use the Casagrande method to determine the liquid limit while the British method uses a fall-cone device; these are briefly described below.
The plastic limit tests described in the three standards are essentially identical.</p>
<div id="liquid-limit" class="section level5" number="5.2.1.2.1">
<h5 number="5.2.1.2.1"><span class="header-section-number">5.2.1.2.1</span> Liquid limit</h5>
<p>The liquid limit test described by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Atterberg1911" role="doc-biblioref">Atterberg</a> (<a href="#ref-Atterberg1911" role="doc-biblioref">1911</a>)</span> lacked reproducibility because it required the operator to manually agitate the soil.
A mechanical test method was first presented by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Casagrande1932" role="doc-biblioref">Casagrande</a> (<a href="#ref-Casagrande1932" role="doc-biblioref">1932</a>)</span> and the method has undergone little alteration up to the present.
The Casagrande apparatus comprises a brass cup fixed to a rotating cam.
A groove is cut in the soil paste.
The soil paste is agitated by dropping the cup against a hard rubber base until the soil begins to flow and the groove closes over a span of 13 mm (1/2 in).
Casagrande arbitrarily defined the liquid limit as the water content needed to close the groove after 25 blows.
Several trials are made and the water content is plotted against the natural logarithm of blow count.
The water content to produce 25 blows is interpolated from this curve.</p>
<p>Several fall-cone methods have been proposed for determining the liquid limit.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>
The fall-cone methods offer several advantages over the Casagrande method and have been widely adopted internationally.
Merits of the fall-cone methods include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Less operator dependency <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Sherwood1970a" role="doc-biblioref">Sherwood and Ryley, 1970</a>)</span></li>
<li>Provide a more straightforward estimate of the soil’s undrained shear strength <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Haigh2016" role="doc-biblioref">Haigh, 2016</a>)</span></li>
<li>Ability to determine the liquid limit for some low-plasticity soils which cannot be tested with the Casagrande cup <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Sherwood1970a" role="doc-biblioref">Sherwood and Ryley, 1970</a>; <a href="#ref-Sivapullaiah1985" role="doc-biblioref">Sivapullaiah and Sridharan, 1985</a>)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>The British Standard is the most widely-used fall-cone method and considers the liquid limit as the water content at which an 80g cone with a single-sided angle of 30° penetrates the sample to a depth of 20 mm <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-BS13771990" role="doc-biblioref">British Standards Institute, 1990</a>)</span>.
Unfortunately, other nations have developed similar methods with different cone masses and angles and comparing results is challenging.
Empirical correlations have been established to convert between the Casagrande LL and the fall-cone LL.
For soils with LL under 100, the two methods give good agreement but for higher-LL soils the cone yields lower LL values <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Holtz2010" role="doc-biblioref">Holtz et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-OKelly2017" role="doc-biblioref">O’Kelly et al., 2017</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Atterberg’s original plastic limit test remains essentially unchanged.
After performing the liquid limit test, a ~5 g sample of soil is gradually dried by gentle blow drying and re-molding.
Once the soil can be molded without sticking to the operator’s skin, the soil is rolled into a thread of 3.2 mm diameter, broken apart, and pressed into a new lump.
This process is repeated until the soil crumbles when the rolling action is applied.
The plastic limit is the water content at which the soil can no longer be rolled out.</p>

<p>Atterberg limit tests can be performed rapidly and require only simple equipment and few consumables.
They also correlate reasonably well with other soil properties such as shear strength, compressibility, and permeability.
Unfortunately there are multiple sources of error associated with the tests and these are often raised as critiques of their utility.

<p>Reproducibility is defined as achieving the same result for the same sample by multiple test operators.
Repeatability is achieving the same result through multiple trials of the same sample by the same operator.</p>

Three soils termed B, G, and W were pulverized and riffled repeatedly to ensure their homogeneity. The samples were sent to 41 laboratories which performed several tests on them, including the Atterberg limits.
The tests were replicated by multiple operators at the Road Research Laboratory and by a single operator to compare the variation among each means of replication.</p>
<p>Results differed widely across laboratories, but agreement was much better for operators trained in the same lab and better still for repeated tests by the same operator.
Figure @ref(fig:sherwood-overall-comparison) shows that extreme values for the liquid limit differed across labs by as much as 30 units.
Plastic limit values varied by up to 19 units (30-40% of their mean values).
Figure @ref(fig:sherwood-overall-comparison) also shows variation across eight individuals employed by the Road Research Laboratory at the time of the study.
These technicians were considered highly experienced and the spread of their results was much smaller than that across laboratories.
Repeatability was better still for a single operator; all six results are tightly clustered around their mean with maximum deviations of 1.2 units for the liquid limit and 0.9 units for the plastic limit.</p>

<p>The spread of data points in Figure @ref(fig:sherwood-overall-comparison) could be seen as misleading because the number of replicates was fewer for the within-lab and within-operator studies than the inter-lab study.
Therefore it is useful to compare the coefficients of variation (COV) for the three studies. Figure @ref(fig:sherwood-cov-comparison) shows that the smaller range of results for a single lab or single operator is due to better precision and not to fewer samples being tested. Compared to the inter-lab study, the COV for one operator’s replicates are smaller by a factor of 10 and the COV for the 8 RRL operators was smaller by a factor of ___.
The coefficient of variation was remarkably consistent across soils: the three materials had COV values of 7.2, 7.5, and 7.9% for the liquid limit and 12.9, 12.8, and 12.8% for the plastic limit.
Evidently, the uncertainty associated with a single test result is not a function of soil type.</p>
<p>The liquid limit involves a mechanical device whereas the plastic limit test introduces a greater degree of operator judgment.
One could expect better agreement for the liquid limit and this is clearly borne out in Figures @ref(fig:sherwood-overall-comparison)-@ref(fig:sherwood-cov-comparison).</p>
<p>A separate study by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Sherwood1970a" role="doc-biblioref">Sherwood and Ryley</a> (<a href="#ref-Sherwood1970a" role="doc-biblioref">1970</a>)</span> showed that the fall-cone method has better inter-operator reproducibility. Figure @ref(fig:sherwood-cone-cup-comparison) shows the spread of the 6 replicated tests for each method. The coefficient of variation among operators was about half that of the Casagrande method.</p>
<p>In summary, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Sherwood1970" role="doc-biblioref">Sherwood</a> (<a href="#ref-Sherwood1970" role="doc-biblioref">1970</a>)</span> showed that most soil physical tests are quite repeatable so long as they are performed by an experienced operator with a well-tuned apparatus and careful workmanship.</p>

<h4 number="5.2.2.2"><span class="header-section-number">5.2.2.2</span> Sources of error in Atterberg limit methods</h4>
<p>@ref(atterberg-limits-reproducibility-and-repeatability) described the expected uncertainties associated with Atterberg limit results.
It is next useful to explore the sources of these errors so they can be avoided as much as possible.
The tests depend heavily on an accurate determination of the water content.
Clean workmanship is essential to avoid flakes of dry soil contaminating the fresh specimen <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Barnes2013" role="doc-biblioref">Barnes, 2013a</a>)</span>.
The laboratory balance in use must be of sufficient sensitivity and calibrated frequently.
The water content determination may comprise a substantial source of error during the tests, although this uncertainty source receives less attention than the test mechanics.
Figure ___ shows a distribution of 50 replicate water content determinations from the same specimen near its LL (data collected by the author).
Even with thorough mixing and the use of a milligram balance, Figure ___ indicates one should expect a standard deviation of ~0.2% water content when sampled from an ostensibly homogenous specimen.</p>
<p>Besides measuring the water content, three chief sources of laboratory error for the Atterberg limits include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>specimen preparation</li>
<li>proper function/calibration of test apparatus</li>
<li>operator technique</li>
</ol>
<p>Each is outlined in the following sections.</p>
<p>Note that these do not include sampling practices, which are carried out prior to laboratory testing and normally comprise a larger source of error than any laboratory procedure <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Brady2007" role="doc-biblioref">Brady and Weil, 2007</a>)</span>.</p>

They showed that a longer “curing” time after adding water slightly increased the optimum water content for compaction (w <sub>opt</sub>).
The effect was small; Δ w<sub>opt</sub> was only ~ 0.5% when using granular/pelletized bentonite and not detectable for powedered bentonite.
The effect of mixing procedure was more apparent.
Mixing water with the sand prior to adding the bentonite increased w<sub>opt</sub> by up to 2% compared with mixing the soil components dry and adding the water last. ρ <sub>max</sub> was also lower when the water was added before the bentonite.
Evidently, the water was more apt to associate with the sand in the latter procedure.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Armstrong1986" role="doc-biblioref">Armstrong and Petry</a> (<a href="#ref-Armstrong1986" role="doc-biblioref">1986</a>)</span> tested 13 means of preparing soil specimens for Atterberg limit tests.
They reported a 4 % water content increase of in the liquid limit due to oven-drying at either 60 or 110 ° C.
This was attributed to difficulty in re-hydrating the clay mineral surfaces and micropores.
If the soil was oven-dried, the liquid limit was increased by curing the sample for 24 hours after adding water.
Another marginal LL increase was noted for a 48-hour cure time.
The relevant finding is that soil specimens should not be oven-dried prior to testing and should be thoroughly cured with water before beginning the test.

The effect was only observed for specific soils, namely those containing iron-oxide cements.

<p>Most attempts to improve the plastic limit test have focused on mechanizing the thread-rolling procedure in hopes of improving its reproducibility across operators.
Test operators utilize different combinations of force, speed, and displacement when rolling the soil. Collectively these variables were termed ‘rolling path’ by <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Barnes2013" role="doc-biblioref">Barnes, 2013a</a>)</span>.
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Bobrowski1992" role="doc-biblioref">Bobrowski and Griekspoor</a> (<a href="#ref-Bobrowski1992" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>)</span> described a simple apparatus to aid the operator in producing a thread of precisely 3.2 mm.
The device consists of a flat plexiglass plate which is used to roll the thread, rather than the operator’s hand. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Bobrowski1992" role="doc-biblioref">Bobrowski and Griekspoor</a> (<a href="#ref-Bobrowski1992" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>)</span> also stated that paper should be affixed to the base of the device to prevent the thread from sliding and to expedite the drying process.
Use of this device is allowed, but not mandated, in the current version of ASTM D4318.
The Bobrowski-Griekspoor device was criticized by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Barnes2013" role="doc-biblioref">Barnes</a> (<a href="#ref-Barnes2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013a</a>)</span>, who cited the data of <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Rashid2008" role="doc-biblioref">Rashid et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Rashid2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span> to assert the rolling device produces excessively rapid drying and eliminates the soil thread from the view of the operator.</p>
<p>A fully mechanized thread rolling apparatus was developed by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Temyingyong2002" role="doc-biblioref">Temyingyong et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Temyingyong2002" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span>. Their device used two acrylic plates similar to <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Bobrowski1992" role="doc-biblioref">Bobrowski and Griekspoor</a> (<a href="#ref-Bobrowski1992" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>)</span> and added a DC motor to apply the rolling action.
The DC voltage was adjusted to control the rolling speed, and the downward force was altered by the addition of weights to the upper plate.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Temyingyong2002" role="doc-biblioref">Temyingyong et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Temyingyong2002" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span> found that the initial diameter of the soil mass explained a larger amount of variation in the test result than did factors which might be ascribed to the subjective manual method (speed and pressure).
The device still appears to be a significant improvement over the hand-rolling method; unfortunately, the device is not commercially available and its use has not been adopted by governing bodies.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Barnes2009" role="doc-biblioref">Barnes</a> (<a href="#ref-Barnes2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span> introduced a novel thread-rolling apparatus which allows precise control of the load applied to the soil thread.
The device comprises two stainless steel plates: a fixed base and an upper loading plate which is manually oscillated.
The load is adjusted by sliding a weight ballast along the side of the device opposite the handle.
The further the ballast weight is from a pivot point, the lesser the load on the soil thread. The device is still operated by hand and a constant rate of rolling must be maintained through careful operation.
A thin smear of petrolatum is used on the stainless steel plates to encourage extrusion of the soil thread.
A number of other useful properties have been developed with this device, as described in the section of this review on soil toughness.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Moreno-Maroto2015a" role="doc-biblioref">Moreno-Maroto and Alonso-Azcárate</a> (<a href="#ref-Moreno-Maroto2015a" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> described a plastic limit test in which a soil thread is bent rather than rolled.
The soil is wetted to a moldable consistency and flattened to ~3 mm.
A special slicing tool is used to create a rectangular prism of soil having precise dimensions of 3 mm x 3mm x 50 mm.
The specimen is then rounded into a cylindrical thread using the same tool.
The thread is carefully bent about its center, which is anchored around a stainless steel cylinder. When the thread begins to crack, a caliper is used to measure the distance between the two ends of the thread.
The test is repeated for at least two other water contents and the water content of the threads is plotted against the displacement with segmented regression.
The shallower segment is extrapolated to zero displacement and this water content is taken as the plastic limit.</p>
<p>Moreno-Maroto and Alonso-Azcàrate (2017???) also described a faster version of their original thread-bending test.
In this version only a single thread is prepared and its displacement and water content are extrapolated to zero displacement using an empirical equation.
This test meets the original requirements of any plastic limit test which could replace the current method, namely:</p>

<p>Toughness is a conspicuous feature of clay soils. It plays an important role on the infield skin because the soil must be both stiff and ductile to achieve the corkboard effect.
This section describes the nature of toughness and research which has measured or modeled it for clay soils.</p>
<div id="definitions-of-toughness" class="section level4" number="5.2.3.1">
<h4 number="5.2.3.1"><span class="header-section-number">5.2.3.1</span> Definitions of toughness</h4>
<p>In mechanics, toughness is the total effort or work required to deform a specimen to its failure condition.
It is mathematically defined as the area beneath a stress-strain curve up to failure.
This integral is traditionally computed over the entire material test, but the strain range may be arbitrarily defined for a specific problem (e.g. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Barnes2013" role="doc-biblioref">Barnes</a> (<a href="#ref-Barnes2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013a</a>)</span>; <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Barnes2013b" role="doc-biblioref">2013b</a>)</span>).
Toughness is a measure of work and bears units of energy per unit volume (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{frac{J}{m^3}}\)</span>) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Mamlouk2006" role="doc-biblioref">Mamlouk and Zaniewski., 2006</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>A large peak strength does not necessarily imply a material is tough.
A brittle material may have a high strength, but because it fails at low strain the toughness is relatively low.
Conversely, a ductile material which deforms to very high strain levels may be quite tough despite its low ultimate strength <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Mamlouk2006" role="doc-biblioref">Mamlouk and Zaniewski., 2006</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Many fine-textured soils exhibit ductile behavior, but their strength in this state varies widely.
This observation is known by those who work intimately with clay in trades such as pottery production or earthworks. Atterberg himself noted that his ‘plasticity number’ did not provide information on the toughness of the soil (Section @ref(atterberg-limits-origins)), and Casagrande noted <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Casagrande1932" role="doc-biblioref">1932</a>)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is a wide variation in the shearing resistance of different soils at the plastic limit. This difference may be felt by hand when performing the plastic limit test on various soils….the toughness of a clay at its plastic limit may therefore be described as the maximum stiffness or shearing resistance which it can acquire without losing its plasticity.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plastic limit is not a test of shear strength or toughness. It merely reflects the water content at which a drying soil becomes brittle.
Regrettably, the distinction has been blurred by authors who report the plastic limit as the water content corresponding to a particular value of cone penetration (for example, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Whyte1982" role="doc-biblioref">Whyte</a> (<a href="#ref-Whyte1982" role="doc-biblioref">1982</a>)</span>).
Reported values of peak strength at the plastic limit differ by up to 2 orders of magnitude <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Haigh2013" role="doc-biblioref">Haigh et al., 2013</a>)</span>. There is no unique shear strength at the plastic limit.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Barnes2009" role="doc-biblioref">Barnes</a> (<a href="#ref-Barnes2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span> described an apparatus which measures soil toughness directly.
Barnes later published a series of papers on the toughness of clays in their pure state, admixed with sand and silt, or blended with other clays <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Barnes2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013a</a>; b; <a href="#ref-Barnes2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.
The Barnes device was originally intended to reduce variability in operator technique during the plastic limit test.
Barnes realized that stress and strain could be measured during the test and these could be translated to toughness.
This work comprises the only published research which directly measured the toughness of clay soils.</p>
<p>Major findings by Barnes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Barnes2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>; <a href="#ref-Barnes2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013a</a>; b; <a href="#ref-Barnes2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>included :</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>New characteristic water contents and indices can be defined in terms of toughness. For example, the toughness coefficient is the rate of change in toughness as a function of water content.</li>
<li>Both clay-size content and clay-mineral content affect toughness. The general order of decreasing toughness at the plastic limit was montmorillonite &gt; illite &gt; kaolinite.</li>
<li>The addition of coarse particles decreased toughness by diluting the clay content. For equal ‘matrix water content’ (i.e. water per unit clay-size material) coarse particles <em>increased</em> toughness because of the increased work required to shear them through the viscous clay matrix. However, maximum toughness was lower for mixed soils because the presence of coarse particles brought the onset of brittle failure at a higher water content due to interparticle interference. these raised the plastic limit relative to the pure clay.</li>
<li>Some clays undergo strain-hardening during the rolling procedure, while others exhibit strain-softening behavior.</li>
<li>The toughness of clays does not always obey a linear law of mixtures. In other words, the behavior of an artificial mixture containing two clays will not necessarily reflect the mixture’s proportions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Barnes apparatus marks a significant advance, but it represents only one means of measuring soil toughness.
Because it is a single, unique apparatus there is no information about the reproducibility of its results across operators.
There is also no research comparing its results with other means of measuring soil toughness.</p>
<p>Clays exhibit toughness during many types of strain, not only the harmonic thread-rolling typical of the plastic limit test which the Barnes device seeks to emulate.
Similarly, the plastic liimit does not represent the true limit of ductile behavior; it merely establishes an arbitratry if useful threshold for a single type of deformation.
A soil can undergo ductile strain even when its water content lies below the plastic limit.
This is readily observed when classifying soils with the USDA field texture evaluation. This method involves forminga ribbon with the thumb and fingers.
A soil can often be “ribboned” but with will crumble if rolled. This highlights the arbitrary nature of the thread rolling test and its cyclic shearing which tends to force air to the center of the thread.</p>
<p>The literature on shear strength and compressive strength is rich, but these studies focus on the peak load at failure and give little mention to energy dissipation up to failure.
In most engineering applications little to no strain is desired.
A baseball field differs because a small amount of deformation to the soil is desirable (Section @ref(#corkboard-section)).</p>

<p>They retained the existing groups in the USCS but added additional groups for soils intermediate between silts and clays.
The new chart eliminated the A-line and instead defined two lines to separate clays from intermediate soils and intermediate soils from silts. The lines were drawn on the basis of toughness computed from their equation and converted to LL and PL values.<br />
Moreno-Maroto and Alonso-Azcárate later compared their own classification system with other systems based on plasticity <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Moreno-Maroto2021" role="doc-biblioref">Moreno-Maroto et al., 2021</a>)</span>.
They noted that USCS tends to classify soils with high liquid limits but low toughness as clays and argued that toughness is the most defining feature of clay and behavior of these soils is more silt-like.
They favored their own use of a quantitative property (toughness) to classify soils rather than the empirical A-line used by USCS.
The author considers this claim to be rather circular because any attempt to classify soils into groups invokes a degree of arbitrariness. The slopes of the C-line and M-line closely match the toughness classification given by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Barnes2009" role="doc-biblioref">Barnes</a> (<a href="#ref-Barnes2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>, but these too are arbitrary. Another limitation of the system described by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Moreno-Maroto2018" role="doc-biblioref">Moreno-Maroto and Alonso-Azcárate</a> (<a href="#ref-Moreno-Maroto2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> is that toughness is computed from an empirical equation and not measured directly.
However, the emphasis on toughness by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Moreno-Maroto2018" role="doc-biblioref">Moreno-Maroto and Alonso-Azcárate</a> (<a href="#ref-Moreno-Maroto2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>; <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Moreno-Maroto2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> is valid and should be explored further.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Vinod2017" role="doc-biblioref">Vinod and Sreelekshmy Pillai</a> (<a href="#ref-Vinod2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> also used data from <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Barnes2013" role="doc-biblioref">Barnes</a> (<a href="#ref-Barnes2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013a</a>)</span> to form an empirical correlation.
Their objective was to predict the optimum moisture content for compaction at any compaction effort without actually performing a Proctor-style compaction test. They hypothesized that the optimum water content for compaction could be predicted from another property defined by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Barnes2013" role="doc-biblioref">Barnes</a> (<a href="#ref-Barnes2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013a</a>)</span>, termed the toughness limit.
Barnes defined the toughness limit as the water content where a soil changes from an unworkable, adhesive consistency to a state having measurable toughness.
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Vinod2017" role="doc-biblioref">Vinod and Sreelekshmy Pillai</a> (<a href="#ref-Vinod2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> first correlated the toughness limits of the 59 soils tested by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Barnes2013" role="doc-biblioref">Barnes</a> (<a href="#ref-Barnes2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013a</a>)</span> with their respective liquidity indexes (<span class="math inline">\(I_L\)</span>, defined as <span class="math inline">\(I_L=LL - LL\)</span>).
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Vinod2017" role="doc-biblioref">Vinod and Sreelekshmy Pillai</a> (<a href="#ref-Vinod2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> found that the average position of the toughness limit was <span class="math inline">\(PL + 0.42 \cdot I_L\)</span>.
In other words, the toughness limit was 42% of the way between the plastic and liquid limits.
This correlation was then used to develop an empirical equation to predict the optimum water content from the plastic limit, liquid limit, and compaction energy.
The authors reported a good correlation, but the spread of their data shows that the optimum water content measured with an actual compaction test routinely differed by 5-10% from the value predicted by their equation.
Although such an equation may be useful for a cursory investigation, the idea that it could replace compaction testing seems spurious.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, particle size analysis is the only means of soil testing which has been applied to infield soils. Mechanical analysis is relatively rapid and inexpensive, and it has been used as a surrogate marker for nearly every aspect of soil science. A tremendous amount of data has accumulated with particle size analysis as its basis. It is useful to examine the principles which underlie the analysis and the development of the techniques, and to identify potential sources of error during the tests.</p>

Particle size analyses were performed on soil sampled from each infield skin. The USDA soil texture of those samples is plotted in @ref(fig:brosnan-survey-usda). These soils were sampled from the upper 13 mm and contained large granules of calcined clay infield conditioner; therefore, the texture measured with this method is coarser than the “true” texture of the base soil.</p>

<p>Natural materials do not always meet the requirements for a particular use.
Natural soils<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> are commonly excavated and blended to benefit their physical or chemical properties <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Brady2007" role="doc-biblioref">Brady and Weil, 2007</a>)</span>.

<blockquote>
<p>“Blending of two soils, producing a new soil with characteristics better than both of its constituents, would be an interesting addition to soil stabilization techniques.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The purpose of blending multiple soils is to create a mixture with properties not exhibited by any naturally occurring soil.
These soils have been termed engineered soils <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Thompson2008a" role="doc-biblioref">Thompson et al., 2008</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Soil mixtures for baseball and softball fields typically contain two materials - a sand and a fine-grained soil.
This section summarizes research about how the components of a soil mixture affect its behavior.
Table @ref(tab:soil-mixture-study-list) also shows that researchers have evaluated soil mixtures using a variety of analyses.
This review focuses on studies which have measured compaction, Atterberg limits, shear strength, and toughness because these properties are the tests most relevant to baseball and softball infields. Other methods which have been utilized include permeability, static compressibility, and pore size distribution.</p>
<p>In this section, the first topic outlined is the rationale for using engineered soils.
Next, the concept of the transitional fines content is introduced. Third, specific research studies on coarse-fine mixtures are discussed Finally, artificial mixtures containing multiple clay types are reviewed.
For brevity, in this section the term “clay” simply refers to the fine-grained mixture component and does not connote any specific definition of texture, particle size, plasticity, or mineralogy.</p>

<h3 number="5.3.1"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> Rationale for producing engineered soils</h3>
<p>Z
Potters and brick masons were the likely first in antiquity to develop engineered soils using simple intuition and experience.
Un-fired bricks containing clay mixed with organic residues have been dated to over 9,000 years before the present <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Staubach2005" role="doc-biblioref">Staubach, 2005</a>)</span>.
Engineered soils are now used for agricultural, horticultural, geotechnical, environmental, and recreational purposes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Leake2014" role="doc-biblioref">Leake and Haege, 2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Control over the mixing process also permits a nearly identical soil to be produced repeatedly.
When natural variation is encountered in the raw materials, the mixture may be adjusted so its final properties do not vary.
The nature of soil solids is wide-ranging. Because these materials may be combined in any ratio, it is easy to imagine the nearly infinite number of possible soil mixtures.</p>
<p>The raw components incorporated into a mixture depend on its intended use.
Materials which retain plant-available water and nutrients are favored for agricultural or horticultural operations.
These include fired or expanded ceramic granules and various types of organic matter.
Soil mixtures produced for engineering applications are usually limited to inorganic components.
Gravel, sand, soil, coal ash, and lime are common components.</p>

<div id="transitional-fines-content" class="section level3" number="5.3.2">
<h3 number="5.3.2"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.2</span> Transitional fines content</h3>
<p>Loads applied to a coarse-grained soil are transmitted through a skeleton of grain-to-grain contacts.
The soil’s behavior is relatively independent of water content.
A minor addition of fine particles will not alter the soil’s behavior so long as the fines fit comfortably within the large voids.<br />
If sufficient fines are added, they begin to participate in the force chain and with further additions the coarse grains become completely suspended in a matrix of fines.
The soil’s behavior becomes dominated by the fines with the coarse grains acting only as inert inclusions.
This threshold has been termed the transitional fines content (TFC).
The global void ratio also increases with fines content &gt; TFC because solid sand particles are displaced by a corresponding volume of fines and inter-fine voids.</p>
<p>Infield soils must exhibit the plasticity of a fine-grained soil but the dimensional stability and workability of a coarse-grained soil.
Therefore, the TFC is a relevant concept to the design of infield mixes.
The following sub-sections review literature on the TFC concept.</p>
<div id="means-to-define-the-tfc" class="section level4" number="5.3.2.1">
<h4 number="5.3.2.1"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.2.1</span> Means to define the TFC</h4>
<p>It is important to acknowledge that the TFC is not a universal number. Most studies report values of 20-30% fines by dry mass, with extreme values ranging from about 15 to 50% <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Kenney1991" role="doc-biblioref">Kenney et al., 1991</a>; <a href="#ref-Vallejo2000" role="doc-biblioref">Vallejo and Mawby, 2000</a>; <a href="#ref-Zuo2015" role="doc-biblioref">Zuo and Baudet, 2015</a>)</span>.
The TFC value varies across mixtures because (1) it depends on the behavioral threshold of interest (for example, compressibility, shear strength, or permeability), and (2) a unique ratio exists for every combination of coarse-grained and fine-grained components.
The total state of particle packing depends on the grain-size distribution of each component, the plasticity of the fines, the means of compaction or consolidation, and the state of effective stress <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Zuo2015" role="doc-biblioref">Zuo and Baudet, 2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Researchers have defined the TFC using several methods (Table @ref(tab:tfc-definition-methods)). A few examples include: calculations from phase relations and index properties <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Lade1998" role="doc-biblioref">Lade et al., 1998</a>; <a href="#ref-Thevanayagam1998" role="doc-biblioref">Thevanayagam, 1998</a>; <a href="#ref-Monkul2007" role="doc-biblioref">Monkul and Ozden, 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-Cabalar2011" role="doc-biblioref">Cabalar, 2011</a>)</span>, the minimum global void ratio following compaction <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Lade1998" role="doc-biblioref">Lade et al., 1998</a>; <a href="#ref-Ueda2011" role="doc-biblioref">Ueda et al., 2011</a>)</span>, undrained shear strength during triaxial tests <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Thevanayagam1998" role="doc-biblioref">Thevanayagam, 1998</a>; <a href="#ref-Vallejo2000" role="doc-biblioref">Vallejo and Mawby, 2000</a>; <a href="#ref-Cabalar2017" role="doc-biblioref">Cabalar and Mustafa, 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-Kim2018" role="doc-biblioref">Kim et al., 2018</a>)</span>, parameters of the normal compression line or critical state line,(<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Cabalar2011" role="doc-biblioref">Cabalar</a> (<a href="#ref-Cabalar2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>; <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Carrera2011" role="doc-biblioref">Carrera et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Carrera2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>; <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Shipton2012" role="doc-biblioref">Shipton and Coop</a> (<a href="#ref-Shipton2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>] and liquefaction potential <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Lade1997" role="doc-biblioref">Lade and Yamamuro, 1997</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>The maximum possible density of a coarse-fine mixture occurs when the fines just fill the large voids in the sand skeleton.
This concept permits a simple estimate of the TFC.
The individual components are assumed to exist at their respective maximum densities (minimum void volumes).
A convenient analytical solution for the global solids volume <span class="math inline">\(V_s\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\\
V_{solids}=1-n_{global}=1-\left[ n_{coarse}\cdot n_{fines}\right]
\\
(\#eq:global-tfc-void-ratio)

<p>where <span class="math inline">\(n_{global}\)</span> is the global porosity and <span class="math inline">\(n_{coarse}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_{fines}\)</span> represent the porosity of each component when packed to their respective maximum densities <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Lade1998" role="doc-biblioref">Lade et al., 1998</a>)</span>.
For example, a sand having a minimum porosity of 0.35 and a clay having a minimum porosity of 0.4, the theoretical maximum solids volume or “packing fraction” of the mixture is <span class="math inline">\(1-\left[0.35\cdot0.40\right]=0.86\)</span> or 14% porosity.</p>
<p>Packing fractions measured in experiments are always lower than their theoretical maxima <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Zuo2015" role="doc-biblioref">Zuo and Baudet, 2015</a>)</span>.
They range from 60% to 95% of the theoretical maximum <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Furnas1931" role="doc-biblioref">Furnas, 1931</a>; <a href="#ref-McGeary1961" role="doc-biblioref">McGeary, 1961</a>; <a href="#ref-Zuo2015" role="doc-biblioref">Zuo and Baudet, 2015</a>)</span>.
The disparity can be attributed to the fact that simplifying assumptions of maximum density of each component and “infinitely small” fines are unlikely to be satisfied <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Zuo2015" role="doc-biblioref">Zuo and Baudet, 2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This simple approach may not reflect the actual behavior of the soil. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Cabalar2011" role="doc-biblioref">Cabalar, 2011</a>)</span> showed that the behavior transition from sand-like to clay-like occurs at a fines content lower than predicted by the global void ratio.
The intergranular void ratio (discussed below) may yield a more accurate prediction of the behavioral threshold.</p>

This parameter enumerates the configuration of large grains within a coarse-fine mixture.
<span class="math inline">\(e_{SA}\)</span> is derived from phase relations (Fig __) by considering the solid fines as voids.</p>
<p>For any fines percent and water content, <span class="math inline">\(e_{SA_{mixture}}\)</span> is compared to the minimum void ratio of the pure sand <span class="math inline">\(e_{min_{pure~sand}}\)</span>.
When <span class="math inline">\(e_{SA_{mixture}}\)</span> exceeds <span class="math inline">\(e_{min_{pure~sand}}\)</span>, soil behavior will no longer be governed by contacts between coarse grains because of their loose configuration.

<p>Most research on the transitional fines content has focused on sand mixed with non-plastic fines.
This research bias is likely due to the high liquefaction risk posed by silts.
It also may reflect the speed at which the experiments can be performed.
Mixtures of sand with silt can be vibrated to their maximum density in an air-dry condition, while investigations of sand mixed with plastic clay require more laborious dynamic compaction methods <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ASTMD698-12e2" role="doc-biblioref">ASTM: D 698 - 00a, 2003</a>; <a href="#ref-ASTMD4253-16" role="doc-biblioref">ASTM D4253, 2014</a>)</span>.

Therefore, by increasing the plasticity of the fines, one would expect the maximum achievable density of a mix to occur at a lower fines content.

<p>Mixtures subjected to static compression in an oedometer exhibit typical void ratio vs. log pressure curves.
When this method is used, higher ultimate density values are attained compared to dynamic compaction tests.
The difference in ultimate density can be attributed to more complete evacuation of air from the voids.
A soil compacted at its optimum water content typically retains air in 5-15% of its void volume (<span class="math inline">\(S_e=0.85-0.95\)</span>) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Holtz2010" role="doc-biblioref">Holtz et al., 2010</a>)</span>.
Slow consolidation from a saturated condition generates a higher final density because there is no entrapped air.
Oedometer experiments on artificial soil mixtures probably have less practical significance than compaction experiments because engineered soils are usually installed in an unsaturated condition.</p>

Three types of clay (kaolinite, illite, and Ca-bentonite) were mixed with varying amounts of sand. All of the sand was &lt; 425 μm.</p>
<p>The liquid limits of the sand-bentonite mixtures were inversely proportional to sand content.
In other words, the water content per unit clay material remained constant.
This relationship was also observed for the illite clay.
A linear relation was observed for the kaolinite clay up to 50 % sand, but the liquid limit test could not be performed on the 75 % sand-25 % kaolinite mixture.
Therefore, it was not clear whether the linear relationship would have persisted above 50 % sand.</p>

The relationship to clay activity held regardless of whether the sand was mixed with a single clay or a pre-blended clay mixture.</p>
<p>The plastic limit of the bentonite-sand mixtures also followed a linear relationship with increasing sand, up to the highest percent sand tested (75%).
The illite and kaolinite clays showed a linear relation only at low sand contents.
With sand content of 50% or higher, the plastic limits were higher than would be predicted by a simple linear regression line.
This suggests that 50% sand is enough for the sand grains to affect the soil’s behavior.</p>
<p>A more precise curve of PL vs. sand content could not be established because of the small number of sand contents tested.
The authors tested only 4 sand contents for the illite clay and 3 sand contents for the kaolinite clay, so a departure from the linear trend could have begun anywhere between 25 and 75% sand.</p>

However, a detailed particle size distribution was not given in this study so it is difficult to know how different the uniformity was between the sands.
It could be assumed that 100% of the sand passed the #40 sieve (425 μm) because this is the standard range of allowed sand sizes in Atterberg limit tests.
If this were the case, the range of sand particle diameters would only fall between ~50 to 425 μm.
This is a relatively narrow range which would preclude efficient particle packing (see Section @ref(#tfc-size-ratio)). It is possible the uniformity would play a bigger role if coarser sand were used in the mixture.</p>

Adding kaolinite to either illite or smectite had a nearly proportional effect on the Atterberg limits.
For example, a mix with a mass percent 50% kaolinite and 50% illite had a liquid limit halfway between the liquid limits of each individual clay.
Mixtures of smectite with illite did not adhere to this linear interpolation.
The liquid limits of the smectite-illite mixes were always lower than predicted by the linear law.
Small additions of illite to smectite lowered the LL by more than expected, and small additions of smectite to illite raised the LL by less than expected.
An opposite effect was observed for the plastic limit. With small bentonite additions, the plastic limit was lower than expected, while for larger bentonite additions it was higher than expected.</p>

<p>Soils are often mixed to beneficiate their properties.
The transitional fines content describes the change from soil behavior dominated by grain-to-grain contacts to behavior dominated by water content and plasticity or toughness.
This threshold has been variously definied according to the problem of interest. There is no universal number to describe its position, which ranges from ~15-35% by mass.
Dominant factors governing the TFC position for a pair of soils include the particle size ratio between them, the void volume of the host sand, and the the plasticity of the fines.</p>
<p>If sand or silt is added to a clay, the amount, size, and shape of the coarse particles can all influence the mixture’s behavior.
Coarse, rotund particles have a small influence on a clay while finer and more irregular particles tend to raise both the plastic and liquid limits of the mix.
Mixing one clay with another results in a mixture whose properties cannot be easily predicted.</p>
<p>These findings collectively demonstrate the complexities which result from the artificial mixing of two or more soils.
This complexity demonstrates the importance of further research on the design of soil mixtures.</p>

<h4 number="5.3.5.1"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.5.1</span> Notable research gaps to address in this project:</h4>
<p>There are no data available on the brittle and ductile response of soil to cleated baseball shoes.
Data pertaining to sand-clay mixes only have tested sand with particle sieve diameters of &lt; 425 μm
The transitional fines content of sand mixed with plastic fines has scarcely been explored
The effect of silt-to-clay ratio has been championed yet without systematic evaluation for the same type of extant clay minerals.</p>
<p>Quantitative analysis has not been applied to the toughness of clays, save for the studies of Barnes who used a cyclic shearing mode similar to that of the standard hand-rolling plastic limit test. In addition, the range of acceptable strain values for a given engineering problem significantly changes the toughness computation. For highly ductile materials, the failure strain is extremely high, and an unacceptably large deformation may be incurred before a failure criterion is reached. In the standard unconfined compression test, the test is halted at 20% strain if a clear peak has not been reached. Toughness is computed as the integral of the stress strain curve from zero strain all the way up to the failure strain. In contrast, Barnes elected to define the toughness of clays as a definite integral from the soil thread diameter of 6 mm down to 4 mm, because in this region deformation of the soil thread was considered to be relatively stable and the stress-strain curves extend with only slight curvature. However this approach may underestimate the toughness of more brittle specimens because the energy dissipated at low strain but high stress is not included in the calculation. It is evident that the strain range chosen for the toughness calculation can substantially change the conclusions about toughness, and one must select the failure criterion carefully based on the problem of interest.</p>

For the purpose of simplicity, this sub-section refers to the two mixture components as “sand” and “clay,” and temporarily ignores these terms’ important particle-size and mineralogical connotations (see {#definition-of-terms}.
Nearly all “sands” have a measurable quantity of particles &lt;2μm sieve diameter, and nearly all “clays” have a measurable quantity of particles &gt;50 μm.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
To produce a mixture having <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>% percent sand-size particles by oven-dry mass requires knowledge of:
- the fines content of the “sand”
- the sand content of the “fines”
- the extant gravimetric water content <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> of each component.</p>
<p>Computing the air-dry masses of each soil then requires a solution to a basic 2-member system of equations as derived below:</p>
<p>Variables are defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(S_{final}\)</span>: the final mixture’s sand percentage as a decimal - <span class="math inline">\(S_{sand}\)</span>: mass fraction of the “sand” &gt; 53 μm as a decimal.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(S_{clay}\)</span>: mass fraction of the “clay” &gt; 53 μm as a decimal</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that because <span class="math inline">\(S_{ sand}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S_{clayey}\)</span> are referenced to different soils,</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math display">\[ S_{sand}~+~S_{clay}~\neq~S_{final} \]</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(m_{sand}\)</span>: oven-dry mass fraction of the “sand” <em>as added to the final mixture</em></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(m_{clay}\)</span>: oven-dry mass fraction of the “clay” <em>as added to the final mixture</em></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(m_{final}\)</span>: the total oven-dry mass of the final mixture, equal to unity.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>: gravimetric water content of a soil, normalized to the oven-dry soil solids, in decimal form.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is first acknowledged that the total oven-dry mass of the mixture is equal to unity:
<span class="math display">\[m_{final} = m_{clay} + m_{sand} = 1\]</span></p>
<p>Re-arranging, the clay mass can be solved as a function of the sand mass:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[m_{clay} = 1 - m_{ sand}\]</span></p>
<p>The percent &gt; 53 &amp;mum; (i.e. sand-size) of the final mixture is a weighted average between the oven-dry sand-size percentages extant in each component and the masses of each component used to make the mixture:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S_{final} = (~m_{sand}~\cdot~S_{sand})~+~(~m_{clay}~\cdot~S_{clay})\]</span>
Substituting for <span class="math inline">\(m_{clay}\)</span>, we obtain</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S_{final} = (~m_{sand}~\cdot~S_{sand})~+~\left[(1-m_{sand}~)\cdot~S_{clay}~\right]\]</span></p>
<p>Which can be distributed and rearranged to isolate <span class="math inline">\(m_{sand}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
S_{final} - S_{clay} &amp;= ( m_{sand} \cdot S_{sand}) - (m_{sand} \cdot S_{clay}) \\ 
S_{final}  -S_{clay} &amp;= m_{sand}\cdot( S_{sand} - S_{clay}) \\
m_{sand} &amp;= \frac{S_f - S_{clay}}{S_{sand} - S_{clay}}\\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>% Each oven-dry component mass is then corrected for its respective hygroscopic water content and scaled to the desired final mixture mass:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
m_{sand (air-dry)} &amp;= m_{sand}\cdot (1+w) \\
\text{Sand~mass~(kg)} &amp;= \frac{S_{clay}-S_{clay}}{S_{sand} - S_{clay}} \cdot (1+w_{sand }) \cdot m_{total~mixture~(kg)} \\
(\#eq:sand-clay-ratios)
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>For example, assume the “sand” component is 96% sand-size, the “clay” is 8% sand-size, and 50 kg of oven-dry final mix is required.
The water content of the sandy component is 0.2%, i.e. 0.002, and the gravimetric water content of the clayey component is 1.9%, i.e. 0.019.</p>
<p>Plugging these values into the equations gives an air-dry sandy component mass of 25.46 kg.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left(\frac{0.60~-~0.08}{0.96~-~0.08}\right)~\times~(1+0.002)~\times43~kg~=~25.46~kg\]</span></p>
<p>To make these calculations efficient and reproducible, the above forumlae have been compiled into a set of functions in the R Language for Statistical Computing.</p>

<h4 number="6.1.3.2"><span class="header-section-number">6.1.3.2</span> Preparing the specimen</h4>
<p>An important consideration in this test’s development is accurately simulating the conditions encountered on actual infields.
As noted in Section {#}, infield soils are intentionally compacted to extremely high densities.
The infield also undergoes frequent wetting and drying cycles. These affect soil water potential and may also induce volume change.</p>
<p>A sample preparation routine was developed using two main criteria:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Emulate the conditions found on actual infields</li>
<li>Reduce operator-dependence by using standardized protocols for initial compaction and subsequent repairs</li>
</ol>
<p>Soils of varying grain size and plasticity exhibit differnt behavior under compaction. Rather than compacting all samples to the same dry density, it was deemed more approproate to compact each sample at its respective optimum water content (<span class="math inline">\(w_{opt}\)</span>). Therefore, a compaction test was required _prior_to any sample construction for actual cleat-mark testing.
The two most widely-used compaction tests are the Standard and Modified Proctor tests, designated by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-ASTMD698-12" role="doc-biblioref">ASTM International</a> (<a href="#ref-ASTMD698-12" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ASTMd15572015" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>ASTMd15572015?</strong></a>)</span>.
The equipment used to compact infield soils is generally smaller than that used for larger earthworks projects.</p>
<p>It is not immediately clear which Proctor test corresponds better to infield soil construction. Unfortunately there is no straightforward conversion between equipment size used in the field and the compaction energy applied during a laboratory test.
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Selig1971" role="doc-biblioref">Selig</a> (<a href="#ref-Selig1971" role="doc-biblioref">1971</a>)</span> provided a formula for a simple case of towing a cylindrical drum towed across the soil surface, but this type of equipment is rarely used on infields and the calculation depends highly on the coefficient of rolling resistance which varies widely. An analytical solution is not necessarily required. In fact, the impact energies employed by both flavors of Proctor test were established by simply comparing the test results with densities observed in actual earthworks projects <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Holtz2010" role="doc-biblioref">Holtz et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-Proctor1932" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>Proctor1932?</strong></a>)</span> .
A similar approach was taken for this study.
Compaction tests were performed were performed on selected soils at both efforts.
The results indicate the Modified test more closely matches the density values achieved during construction of actual infield surfaces (Figure @ref(fig:duraedge-standard-vs-modified).
A pilot experiment was also performed to determine determine whether a a notable difference in sample behavior occurred between the two energy levels.</p>
<p>A proctor test was performed for each sample to determine the proper water content for compaction into the custom cleat-mark cylinders.
A rough estimate of <span class="math inline">\(w_{opt}\)</span> was made by adding small amounts of water to a hand specimen.
The gravimetric water content was determined and five total aliquots were prepared - one at this water content, with two drier and two wetter.
Appropriate amounts of water were incorporated by hand to yield <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> spacing of ~0.02.
Samples were cured in plastic bags for ≥ 16 hr.
Each specimen was compacted and weighed, and a representative sample was removed for the water content determination.
To derive <span class="math inline">\(w_{opt}\)</span>, a polynomial spline was fitted to the plot of dry density vs. water content.
The function’s first derivative was set to zero and the <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{max}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w_{opt}\)</span> values were computed by setting the curve’s derivative to zero and interpolating at this point (Figure @ref(fig:deriving-proctor-values).
<!-- This approach is further documented in **soiltestr**.  -->
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-ASTMD698-12" role="doc-biblioref">ASTM International</a> (<a href="#ref-ASTMD698-12" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> suggests the operator draw the compaction curve manually, but a computational approach
removes operator judgement and makes the analysis more reproducible.
See <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Howell1997" role="doc-biblioref">Howell et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Howell1997" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Webb2014" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>Webb2014?</strong></a>)</span> for other examples of fitting mathematical functions to Proctor data.</p>

<p>A sufficient mass of air-dry soil was then brought to the appropriate <span class="math inline">\(w_{opt}\)</span> for the test energy.

<div id="conversion-of-proctor-test-energy-per-volume-to-cleat-mark-cylinder-equivalent" class="section level5" number="6.1.3.2.1">
<h5 number="6.1.3.2.1"><span class="header-section-number">6.1.3.2.1</span> Conversion of Proctor test energy-per-volume to cleat-mark cylinder equivalent</h5>
<p>Due to the design of the pneumatic device, a direct protocol translation between the Proctor mold and the cleat-mark cylinders was not possible.
The Proctor mold is 10.2 cm diameter x 11.4 cm deep.
The pneumatic test device was designed to hold cylinders with a 10.2 cm (4 in) deep soil profile.
This is a commonly used specification for infield construction.
At this depth, a fully-loaded cylinder containing moist soil has a mass of ~5.5 kg.
Unfortunately, the automatic turntable for the 3D scanner has a maximum capacity of 5 kg and a means to reduce the specimen mass was required.
2.5 cm cylindrical plugs were fabricated from high-strength polymer resin poured into each cylinder @ref(fig:resin-plugs).
The resin has a bulk density of just ~0.6 Mg m<sup>-3</sup> so the plugs reduce the total specimen mass to ~ 4.5 kg while maintaining a profile depth of 7.5 cm.
After inserting the plugs, each cylinder’s volume was precisely determined by filling it with de-aired water and recording the filled mass.
This procedure allows precise density computations despite any differences in the plugs’ sizes.
A conversion was then developed to equate eac Proctor test energy to
the larger cleat mark cylinder. The conversion for the Standard test
(25 blows per layer, 3 layers) is straightforward because the new total profile thickness (3 in or 7.5 cm) corresponds exactly to 2/3 of the regular Proctor mold.
Therefore the lift thickness is held constant and the number of lifts is simply reduced to 2. 56 blows per layer are used for the 15 cm-diameter mold.
The Modified test calls for 5 lifts, which is not evenly divisible into the new total height.
An additional energy conversion is required to translate the Modified compaction routine to the cleat-mark cylinders.
This calculation is outlined in Equation @ref(eq:modified-energy-per-volume).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*} 
\frac{E_{Modified~Proctor_{total}}}{vol_{Modified~Proctor}}&amp;=\frac{E_{cleat-mark_{total}}}{vol_{cleat-mark}} \\
\frac{2700~\frac{kJ}{m^3}}{978~cm^3}&amp;=\frac{E_{cleat-mark_{total}}}{1537~cm^3} \\
E_{cleat-mark_{total}}&amp;=~4243 \frac{kJ}{m^3} \\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>A single blow of the Modified hammer applies:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
E&amp;=mgh \\
E&amp;=\frac{4.54~kg}{}~\times~\frac{9.81~m}{s^2}~\times~\frac{0.457~m}{} \\
E&amp;=\frac{\frac{20.34~kgm^2}{s^2}}{\text{blow}} \\
&amp;=\frac{20.34~J}{\text{blow}} \\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore a total energy of 4243 kJ requires:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\frac{4243~J}{\text{cylinder}}\times\frac{1~\text{blow}}{20.34~J}=209~\text{blows per cylinder} \\
(\#eq:modified-energy-per-volume)
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Split over 3 layers, <span class="math inline">\(209 / 3 \approx 70\)</span> blows per layer are required.</p>

<h5 number="6.1.3.2.2"><span class="header-section-number">6.1.3.2.2</span> Comparison of density achieved during Proctor tests and cleat-mark compaction routine</h5>
<p>To validate the energy conversion outlined in @ref(eq:modified-energy-per-volume), the masses and water contents of each cylinder were recorded following compaction.
Three replicates of two soils at both energies were prepared for a total of 12 specimens.</p>
<p>These were compared with the values of ρ<sub>max</sub> and w<sub>opt</sub> derived from the original Proctor test (either standard or modified).</p>
<p>Three replicated specimens were prepared from two soils.
Figure @ref(fig:proctor-vs-cleat-mark-achieved-density-fig) shows that the three replicates have very similar dry densities and that the cleat-mark compaction routine packed them to a slightly lower dry density than the Modified test.
This result corresponds well with prior research on varying the mold diameter of compaction tests.
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ASTMD698-12e1" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>ASTMD698-12e1?</strong></a>)</span> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Results have been found to vary slightly when a material is tested at the same compactive effort in different size molds, with the smaller mold size typically yielding larger values of density/unit weight.”</p>

<p>The soils will be wetted to their adhesion limit and packed into a 5-cm diameter steel tube with a dynamic compaction effort of 2,700 kN-m/m<sup>3</sup> (equivalent to the ASTM modified Proctor compaction test, D1557-12e1 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ASTMD15572015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>. The soil will be packed in a single lift to minimize heterogeneities in the specimen which could arise due to lack of binding between successive lifts. Preparing the specimens in a relatively soft condition also ensures minimal air entrapment. For each mixture, 6 replicate cylinders will be prepared.</p>
<p>The specimens will be extruded with a manual hydraulic bottle jack (Figure @ref(fig:proctor-extruder)). One specimen will be immediately sealed in an air-tight plastic bag. The rest will be slowly air dried under a loose polyethylene sheet. Each specimen will be dried to progressively lower water contents and sealed in a plastic bag until testing, with the final specimen being completely air-dried. The goal is to evaluate at least 3 water contents where ductile behavior is observed and at least 2 samples where brittle behavior is observed. This will allow the maximum toughness value to be bracketed by the tests.</p>

Figure @ref(fig:barnes-toughness-vs-water-content-example-plot) shows such a plot.</p>
<p>Finally, the coefficients from the toughness-water content relationship for each sample can be analyzed as a function of sand content and clay type. This two-way ANOVA will permit the toughness slope to be computed for any soil based on its initial toughness.</p>

<h3 number="6.6.2"><span class="header-section-number">6.6.2</span> Hypotheses</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Infield mix design should start with the toughness of an available clay soil, not the final sand %.</li>
<li>The level of play and maintenance budget will dictate the desired toughness level.</li>
<li>The upper bound of the amount of clay soil component that should be included in the mix is a function of the dry shear strength of the mix because it is this property that governs the workability of the mix (i.e. the ability to groom it with implements and hand tools)</li>
<li>If a given toughness level is desired, the % sand needed to achieve this can be computed from empirical equations.</li>
<li>Ideally, toughness should be directly measured when designing a new mix; however it can also be estimated from an empirical correlation with the Atterberg limits</li>
<li>Particle size analysis is acceptable for quality control purposes, but not for design. Only once a desired blend of a particular sand with a particular clay is established through toughness testing can a definite ratio of sand-size particles to fines be defined for that mix.</li>
<li>Amending existing soils should be done on the basis of plastictity rather than silt-to-clay ratio. The resulting mixture’s properties will not be a linear interpolation between the two; thus a calibration of Atterberg limit results may be required by making several mixtures (for example 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% of soil A with the implied amount of soil B) to determine the proper amendment ratio.</li>

<p>This paper is primarily a synthesis of the methods papers described above. It will combine the methods into a single framework for designing infield mixes. Simple metrics will be defined, and the framework will be tested by using materials which were <em>not</em> tested in the other experiments to validate the theory’s merit.</p>

<p>This is the final paper I will write as it encompasses all the lab work and other publications. I anticipate writing it in the second half of 2022.</p>
<p>The end game/envisaged process of mix design:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Decide what toughness value you want - this is determined by the level of play and maintenance capability.</p></li>
<li><p>Test the toughness of the pure “clay” (or estimate it from the empirical equation published by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Moreno-Maroto2018" role="doc-biblioref">Moreno-Maroto and Alonso-Azcárate</a> (<a href="#ref-Moreno-Maroto2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, or hopefully via an even better equation I will make with my compression test method for toughness)</p></li>
<li><p>Use an empirical equation I will develop to interpolate along the dose-respone curve of toughness vs. sand content. It will probably be linear for coarse sand and non-linear for finer sand. Probably I would need to develop multiple equations based on the properties of the sand….either choose from two or three equations (i.e. sand too fine, sand ok, sand excellent), or what would be even better (but probably beyond the scope of my own project and therefore a great starter for one of my future grad students) is to represent the sand variable as something continuous, such as mean particle diameter, or better yet specific surface area (could derive this from PSA curve with a correctly-fitted model) and then you would have <em>two</em> continuous variables with which to form the dose-response curve. Anyway, you interpolate on this curve to get the sand-clay ratio you want, then make the mixture from that ratio. In this way the properties of the resultant mixture are not only replicable, they are precisely controllable. You have your hand on the dial!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Basically you end up with a line plotting toughness against % sand. The nature of the line is determined by :
1. the intercept of the line is determined by the initial toughness (i.e. that of the “pure” clay soil component) which is in turn determined by the mineralogy and particle size of the clay soil component.
2. the slope is determined <em>both</em> by the type of clay (i.e. the slope is a function of toughness; tougher clays will not be dilluted as easily; they will retain their toughness at higher sand contents; their slopes will be shallower) <strong>and</strong> the type of sand (i.e. the slope is a function of sand type, but only above ~20% sand)</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the larger the athletes the higher the toughness you want. The maximum toughness that can be used as an infield mix is governed by the strength of dry clods because they have to be draggable. This is complicated by the use of conditioner because they will increase the friability of the soil when used on a real infield. So you can use a base soil which has slightly higher toughness than would really be acceptable if there were no conditioner around….but how much higher is a hard question to answer. To find out you would have to do a conditioner titration on the soils which bracket this transition.</p>
