This is my PhD proposal, finally being compiled. I am using **bookdown**, R
Studio, Git, and GitHub to make the process transparent and easier. It will be
simple to compile the various documents together, auto-format citations, etc. 

Thank you Yihui and everyone else for creating these tools. I love Microsoft, but 
NO WAY am I going back to the copy-paste mindset!
