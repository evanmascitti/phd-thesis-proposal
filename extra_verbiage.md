Deviations from this ideal occur due to the nature of the constituent particles in the soil and their interactions with water. Rotational and translational motions of the athlete impose shearing forces on the infield surface. Shear force is defined as a force component co-planar with a potential failure surface (Coloumb or similar reference). If the shear force is large enough to induce yield, the yield may manifest as either ductile deformation of the soil matrix, or as a complete rupture of the soil at a depth approximating the stud length. A clod of soil decoupled from the surrounding area creates two surface imperfections: the clod itself, and an indentation in the surface. If impacted by a batted ball, these imperfections may alter the ballâ€™s trajectory and cause a fielder to misplay the hop. Clods are unsightly, and once abraded to their constituent soil particles, the loosened soil contributes to surface dust when dry and stickiness when wet. Therefore, groundskeepers attempt to maintain the infield in a condition which maximizes ductile behavior and minimizes the generation of clods during play.
