Deviations from this ideal occur due to the nature of the constituent particles in the soil and their interactions with water. Rotational and translational motions of the athlete impose shearing forces on the infield surface. Shear force is defined as a force component co-planar with a potential failure surface (Coloumb or similar reference). If the shear force is large enough to induce yield, the yield may manifest as either ductile deformation of the soil matrix, or as a complete rupture of the soil at a depth approximating the stud length. A clod of soil decoupled from the surrounding area creates two surface imperfections: the clod itself, and an indentation in the surface. If impacted by a batted ball, these imperfections may alter the ball’s trajectory and cause a fielder to misplay the hop. Clods are unsightly, and once abraded to their constituent soil particles, the loosened soil contributes to surface dust when dry and stickiness when wet. Therefore, groundskeepers attempt to maintain the infield in a condition which maximizes ductile behavior and minimizes the generation of clods during play. 

___

The desired degree of stiffness may differ according to the level of play; lower stiffness may be preferred for a youth playing surface while professional-level fields require more resistance to the forces imposed by the larger athletes.  

___

Note that the curve is purely conceptual and its shape bears no quantitative significance.  (caption to a figure showing inverted parabola to describe infield "performance" vs water content)

___

As an infield soil's water content reduces, it transitions from the ideal "corkboard" state to a somewhat fragile condition permitting more disturbance before eventually becoming very hard. This change can be described as a brittle-ductile transition. An analogous transition is observed in materials such as glass, hydrocarbons, and metals as their temperature changes [@Barnes2013]. The Swedish chemist Albert Atterberg (1846-1916) is credited with the canonical account of a brittle-ductile transition in fine-grained soil [@Atterberg1911; @Atterberg1974]. This topic has subsequently received much study and it is further scrutinized in . 

Particle size analysis has been the sole basis for attempts to classify infield soils and to modify their performance. This literature review casts doubt on the ability of PSA to relate to actual soil behavior, and both the precision and accuracy of this enterprise is dubious.

As the soil thread began to desaturate, these large voids provide a network through which cracks can propagate, leading to the crumbling of the soil thread.

The system presently in use is based entirely on grain size. It represents considerable advancement over the practice of 
excavating a sub-horizon of local soil,
screening it from large rocks and debris and installing it as the infield soil. 

The contributions of the soil suppliers and grounds managers who developed this 
system cannot be over-stated. The author has personally benefitted from this framework

Regrettably, this increase in performance has generated overly optimistic beliefs / assessments/ judgments about the system's general applicability.

 toward all infield soils.  of this paradigm to those who use it. 
The behavior of fine-grained soil is governed not only by grain size, but by the surface charge and shape of soil solids. 

Widespread adoption of this paradigm has not been tacit - its popularity lies in both its simplicity and the fact that it _does_ represent 
considerable advancement. 

There is reason to believe that better infield mixes may be manufactured for a lower cost if a unifying framework for designing the mixes is developed.

___

While plasticity describes the state of the soil in a qualitative way, toughness is a quantitative material property.  
___

Ball response is not a topic of direct study in this project. However, because ball response is ultimately affected by the other topics of interest in this prokect, and because the existing literature on baseball field ball response is thin, a brief summary is warranted.

### Summary of problem importance 

Infield skin soils are important to both economic and competitive aspects of baseball. Little research has been carried out on these materials. It is evident that the topic is ripe for study and that experiments regarding the nature and performance of infield soils would benefit the interests of many groups.

___

He scorned qualitative definitions of soils and favored the use of quantitative descriptions:

___

Ideally, researchers and practitioners could measure all soil properties of interest on an unlimited number of samples. 

___

Atterberg deemed the plasticity number as the most reliable means of measuring plasticity, though one senses his reluctance to accept this simple number as a fully adequate measure. 

___

The battery of tests included particle size analysis by hydrometer, specific gravity, Proctor-style compaction, liquid limit, and plastic limit.
___

However, he concluded with a more optimistic tone by surmising that results could be improved with better operator training and a providing them with more feedback. He suggested that operators be offered opportunity to calibrate their own results to those for standard materials having established values. 

___


The remolded zone around the indentation is likely to be smaller and more uniform with space [@Deepa2013]. Ductile behavior is usually associated with higher mechanical strain and more generation of heat [@Perez2017]. The remolded zone surrounding the cleat will be small [@Perez2017]. 

___



**The anticipated outcomes from this research are:**
  
1. New laboratory methods for measuring the behavior of baseball and softball infield soils
2. A quantitative framework for designing new infield mixes and amending existing infields
3. Refereed journal publications, trade magazine articles, and technical presentations
4. Software which can be used beyond this project's scope and lifespan

Of Atterberg's original 5 limits, only (2) and (4) are in use today and they are termed the liquid and plastic limits respectively. 
The following sections detail the mechanics underlying these tests and their limitations.

The term “clay” connotes varied meanings to different fields. In this dissertation, in the spirit of brevity, I use the term “clay” in this dissertation in its colloquial sense- that is a fine-grained soil material that can be shaped and molded. When soil mixtures are made one does not typically consider only the fraction of mineral solids having < 2 μm equivalent Stoke’s diameter. Instead, the mix is made on the basis of a specified ratio between 2 or more soils which are combined. 
____

A qualitative definition of the transitional fines content is when the behavior of a soil mixture becomes more similar to the behavior of the fines alone than the sand alone. A transition in actual soil behavior, however defined, is of greater practical interest than a surrogate marker such as void ratio [which is more aptly considered a state parameter than an index property].

__

Although the shape of the coarse fraction had a measurable influence, its role was small compared to the coarse fraction's particle size and the nature of the clay minerals. (Dumbleton and West, 1966b)
___

When the soil offers adequate resistance to foot traffic, play may continue during rain. Once the resistance is lowered enough to make footing unsafe, the game is halted, and the grounds crew covers the field with an impermeable tarp to prevent further saturation. Rain delays and postponements lead to lost revenue and create schedule conflicts at both the professional and recreational levels. Moreover, deployment of the tarp during rainfall is dangerous and physically difficult.
Even when weather conditions are favorable, high toughness allows the groundskeeper a wider range of water contents to provide excellent playability. This minimizes mistakes when hand-watering the infield. 

The groundskeeper is unable to add water to the infield once the game has begun. In hot and dry weather., the soil dries and becomes excessively hard as the game progresses, affecting ball response and also inducing brittle bulking from cleat (Ch. __). Therefore soil toughness also allows the soil to retain its plastic behavior as soil moisture is reduced.

#### Volume and mass relations

The amount of each component in a soil mixture may be reported on a volumetric or mass basis. 
Soil suppliers often describe their mixes by the loose volume of each component prior to mixing (for example, 80% sand with 20% peat). 
The relative dry mass of solids is considered more absolute because these never change despite fluctuations in water content or bulk density. 
The ratios or percentage to which the component fractions are normalized should also be made explicit. The mass of each component usually normalized to the total dry mass: 

$$ \%~sand~=\frac{g_{sand}}{(g_{sand}+g_{clay})} $$
However, others have advocated for enumerating the amount of sand to the amount of clay. For example, if 40 grams sand are added to 100 grams clay, this mixture would be termed 40% sand [@ British clays textbook]. 

$$ \%~sand~=\frac{g_{sand}}{g_{clay}} $$

This approach is analogous to computing water content as the mass of water related to the mass of dry soil. However, it is rarely used in scientific literature.   


<!-- this paragraph has to get re-worked , too clumsy and verbose-->
Mass-based measures are the most rational basis for mixing and testing, but soil behavior is governed by particle-to-particle relations in space. Volumetric relations provide a more accurate depiction of the soil’s behavior, especially when the mixture components have very different specific gravities. If relative masses are known, volumetric relations may be readily computed from phase relations.

#### Intergranular void ratio

The term intergranular void ratio was introduced by @Thevanayagam1998 to describe the configuration of large grains in a coarse-fine mixture. 
Intergranular void ratio may be derived from phase relations (Fig __) by considering the solid fines as voids within the bulk volume, which is held equal to unity.
 
The intergranular void ratio may be compared with the minimum void ratio of the pure sand. When the void ratio of the granular phase surpasses that of the host sand, behavior will no longer be governed by contact between coarse grains. 

** good verbiage here : ** 
Minimum porosity of a mixture occurs when the fines and their interfine voids are just sufficient to fill the sand skeleton's larger voids.
Many authors have defined the TFC as the fines content which produces the lowest total void space. This approach may not reflect the actual behavior of the soil because the global void ratio may not reach its minimum until $e_{sand}$ has already exceeded the minimum $e_{sand}$ for the host sand alone. The coarser grains act mostly independent of one another and behavior is already governed by the fines, thus the transition occurs at a lower fines content than would be suggested by the global void ratio [@Cabalar2011].

[need to remake this plot. The axes are technically correct but they are not plotted in the standard USDA way.]

@Brosnan2008a surveyed the surface conditions of the infield skin on extant playing fields at three maintenance levels. Particle size analyses were performed on soil sampled from each infield skin. The USDA soil texture of those samples is plotted in \@ref(fig:brosnan-survey-usda). @Brosnan2008a noted thtat these soils were sampled from the upper 13 mm and contained large granules of calcined clay infield conditioner; therefore, the texture measured with this method is coarser than the "true" texture of the base soil.

Quantitative analysis has not been applied to the toughness of clays, save for the studies of Barnes who used a cyclic shearing mode similar to that of the standard hand-rolling plastic limit test. In addition, the range of acceptable strain values for a given engineering problem significantly changes the toughness computation. For highly ductile materials, the failure strain is extremely high, and an unacceptably large deformation may be incurred before a failure criterion is reached. In the standard unconfined compression test, the test is halted at 20% strain if a clear peak has not been reached. Toughness is computed as the integral of the stress strain curve from zero strain all the way up to the failure strain. In contrast, Barnes elected to define the toughness of clays as a definite integral from the soil thread diameter of 6 mm down to 4 mm, because in this region deformation of the soil thread was considered to be relatively stable and the stress-strain curves extend with only slight curvature. However this approach may underestimate the toughness of more brittle specimens because the energy dissipated at low strain but high stress is not included in the calculation. It is evident that the strain range chosen for the toughness calculation can substantially change the conclusions about toughness, and one must select the failure criterion carefully based on the problem of interest.

Many of the tests will be performed on the same soil mixtures and the experiments, while treated separately, have substantial overlap. 
Therefore the testing program will be structured to minimize bottlenecks. 
In other words, multiple experiments will be in progress at a given time because some of the protocols involve wait times (i.e. for several hours or overnight) during which other lab tasks can be performed.

### Rationale for producing engineered soils


Materials which retain plant-available water and nutrients are favored for agricultural or horticultural operations. 
These include fired or expanded ceramic granules and various types of organic matter. 
Soil mixtures produced for engineering applications are usually limited to inorganic components.
Gravel, sand, soil, coal ash, and lime are common components [@Holtz2010]. ___

These are normally referred to by soil suppliers as "sand" and "clay," irrespective of the size or nature of their constituent particles. 
For brevity, in this section the term “clay” simply refers to the fine-grained mixture component of a soil mixture.
It does not connote any specific definition of texture, particle size, plasticity, or mineralogy.

#### Factors affecting TFC value

The TFC for a given set of mix components varies widely. 
This section describes factors which govern the value of the TFC.

Plasticity tests are geared toward fine-grained soils but the presence of particles in the silt-size and sand-size regions also affect the test results.

This could be really useful later as it is a good paper:


@Nagaraj2016 tested the unconfined shear strength of sand-clay mixes made from varying gradations and proportions of sand.
The mixtures contained with either kaolinite or montmorillonite.
For both types of clay an "optimum" sand content was identified for maximum shear strength.
This value ranged from 40-60% sand: shear strength was maximized in this range, with lower shear strengths observed when either more or less sand was included.
The authors suggested that sand content of 40-60% maximizes the frictional interaction between the sand grains without reducing the ability of the clay to strengthen the mix.
A limitation of this study is that all mixtures were tested immediately after compaction at their respective values for $w_{opt}$.
Shear strength is a function of water content, so the "optimum" sand content is likely different at various water contents.
In other words, sandier mixes would likely have greater shear strength at high water contents but mixes with more clay would have higher shear strength when dry.
