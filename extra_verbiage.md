Deviations from this ideal occur due to the nature of the constituent particles in the soil and their interactions with water. Rotational and translational motions of the athlete impose shearing forces on the infield surface. Shear force is defined as a force component co-planar with a potential failure surface (Coloumb or similar reference). If the shear force is large enough to induce yield, the yield may manifest as either ductile deformation of the soil matrix, or as a complete rupture of the soil at a depth approximating the stud length. A clod of soil decoupled from the surrounding area creates two surface imperfections: the clod itself, and an indentation in the surface. If impacted by a batted ball, these imperfections may alter the ballâ€™s trajectory and cause a fielder to misplay the hop. Clods are unsightly, and once abraded to their constituent soil particles, the loosened soil contributes to surface dust when dry and stickiness when wet. Therefore, groundskeepers attempt to maintain the infield in a condition which maximizes ductile behavior and minimizes the generation of clods during play. 

___

The desired degree of stiffness may differ according to the level of play; lower stiffness may be preferred for a youth playing surface while professional-level fields require more resistance to the forces imposed by the larger athletes.

Note that the curve is purely conceptual and its shape bears no quantitative significance.  (caption to a figure showing inverted parabola to describe infield "performance" vs water content)

As an infield soil's water content reduces, it transitions from the ideal "corkboard" state to a somewhat fragile condition permitting more disturbance before eventually becoming very hard. This change can be described as a brittle-ductile transition. An analogous transition is observed in materials such as glass, hydrocarbons, and metals as their temperature changes [@Barnes2013]. The Swedish chemist Albert Atterberg (1846-1916) is credited with the canonical account of a brittle-ductile transition in fine-grained soil [@Atterberg1911; @Atterberg1974]. This topic has subsequently received much study and it is further scrutinized in . 

Particle size analysis has been the sole basis for attempts to classify infield soils and to modify their performance. This literature review casts doubt on the ability of PSA to relate to actual soil behavior, and both the precision and accuracy of this enterprise is dubious.

, possibly due to the development of large intergranular voids. In order to allow the soil to be rolled into a thread, these larger voids likely 

As the soil thread began to desaturate, these large voids provide a network through which cracks can propagate, leading to the crumbling of the soil thread.

The system presently in use is based entirely on grain size. It represents considerable advancement over the practice of 
excavating a sub-horizon of local soil,
screening it from large rocks and debris and installing it as the infield soil. 

The contributions of the soil suppliers and grounds managers who developed this 
system cannot be over-stated. The author has personally benefitted from this framework

Regrettably, this increase in performance has generated overly optimistic beliefs / assessments/ judgments about the system's general applicability.

The behavior of fine-grained soil is governed not only by grain size, but by the surface charge and shape of soil solids. 

Widespread adoption of this paradigm has not been tacit - its popularity lies in both its simplicity and the fact that it _does_ represent 
considerable advancement. 

There is reason to believe that better infield mixes may be manufactured for a lower cost if a unifying framework for designing the mixes is developed.

___

While plasticity describes the state of the soil in a qualitative way, toughness is a quantitative material property.  
___

Ball response is not a topic of direct study in this project. However, because ball response is ultimately affected by the other topics of interest in this prokect, and because the existing literature on baseball field ball response is thin, a brief summary is warranted.

### Summary of problem importance 

Infield skin soils are important to both economic and competitive aspects of baseball. Little research has been carried out on these materials. It is evident that the topic is ripe for study and that experiments regarding the nature and performance of infield soils would benefit the interests of many groups.

___

He scorned qualitative definitions of soils and favored the use of quantitative descriptions:

___

Ideally, researchers and practitioners could measure all soil properties of interest on an unlimited number of samples. 

___

Atterberg deemed the plasticity number as the most reliable means of measuring plasticity, though one senses his reluctance to accept this simple number as a fully adequate measure. 

___

The battery of tests included particle size analysis by hydrometer, specific gravity, Proctor-style compaction, liquid limit, and plastic limit.
___

However, he concluded with a more optimistic tone by surmising that results could be improved with better operator training and a providing them with more feedback. He suggested that operators be offered opportunity to calibrate their own results to those for standard materials having established values.
